I find this place boring. It's entertaining sure but I expected more figuring so many people talk about it. All you do is jump around on a thousand trampolines. Not for toddlers I don't think. More for older kids. We stayed a little then came to monkey joes. I find it to be a lot more fun and entertaining. Definitely keeps my son busy for quite a few hours.	negative
I wish I could speak as highly of this place as I do all the other restaurants in the Golden Nugget, but I simply cannot.  During our 9 -day stay in Las Vegas, we visited this caf\u00e9 several times and the service at each visit was more disappointing than the last.  After four visits, we decided that it was not going to get any better.  It is clear that the staff here is unionized and they seem to take advantage of this security by not bothering to expend energy to be courteous or timely in their service.  The food is mediocre at best (think Denny's) yet overpriced and served begrudgingly.  Note: the coffee here is plentiful but acrid.  \n\nOne visit stands out: after being seated by a hostess who didn't bother to speak to us or even make eye contact, a person (bus person, assistant?) inquired as to whether we would like something to drink.  We ordered two coffees, two water and two large orange juices.  This person said to us \""I can get you water and coffee but orange juice must be ordered from your server...pleeeeease!\"" It was obvious to both of us that we were being scolded for breaching an unknown and unspoken \""rule\"" about orange juice.  Our server finally came and almost convinced us that he wasn't totally bored while taking our order (including orange juice).  The meal took 15 minutes to arrive, sans OJ.  Later the server brought the check, reviewing it as he placed it on the table, and asked \""Did you ever get your orange juice?\""  We began to reiterate to him that we were told that only he could take that order but he abruptly walked away.  He did return with our OJ...just as we finished our meal.  We definitely could've lived without the OJ...and the attitude from the service staff. \n\nThis place is large, open 24 hours and very close to the pool but those are its only positive qualities.  There are other viable options on Fremont Street...especially for breakfast!  Du-Par's in the Golden Gate is the BEST!   If you do decide to dine here, my advice is to keep your expectations low.	negative
Please see Mr Ghetto - Walmart on youtube before reading this review. The wally world featured on this video is cleaner and better stocked than the one in this location. You have to wade through the small army of lazy bums panhandling (saw one in a leather jacket one time) before getting to the store or back to your car every time! I avoid taking my family here for safety sake so i usually go here by myself. That's only if I really have to go here unless I want to drive the extra 10 min to go to a better walmart down Craig Road.	negative
The translated \""Il Vinaio\"" is an ancient Italian word meaning \""polished turd\"". The pretentious menu, the \""Denny's\"" environment. The dated and uninspiring wine list. Fake yelp reviews, rude replies to yelp reviews.  Reviews that have no other reviews or friends, are obviously  fake yelp profiles, sad . Clearly unprofessional \""foodies\"" have no place in the restaurant industry, this place makes the Taco Bell next door  look bad. Keep polishing that turd, I heard the best way is to suck at both ends.	negative
I came to watch a friend's Roller Derby match. The facility looks like it may have been pretty great once, but doesn't appear to have been maintained well. The floos don't seem like they've had a good cleaning in a long time. Everything just seems a little dated and worn out.	negative
I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.	negative
We were on a hunt for food before seeing a show at the Garden and settled on Emeril's. I love experiencing a chef's vision and was really excited to finally see Emeril's come to life. We chose this spot because they had a large bar and a TV and hoped to catch some football before continuing on with our night's festivities and get some tasty bites. \n\nUnfortunately, this experience has made me think twice about not only my fixation about going to a \""mainstream\"" chef's restaurant but also my admiration for Emeril. \n\nFirst, when we arrived there were two people at the bar and approximately twenty or so employees that appeared to be setting up for dinner service. The hostess up front greeted us and after explaining that we wanted to try to watch some football, suggested we sit at the bar. Perfect, so far so good. We were seated at the bar and waited....and watched as the bartenders and bar backs moved back and forth. Not one person greeted us for ten minutes...I understand that there is a certain amount of prep work required before the dinner service, but not acknowledging patrons is inexcusable. Once we finally were able to flag a bartender, we politely asked if we would be able to switch the channel on the TV to one that showed the game. The bartender said that he would have to ask the other patrons if that was fine which made sense but he was so dismissive that it automatically got my defenses up. Apparently, we were bothering him by asking him to change the channel on the TV. There were only two other patrons at the bar and thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it was for this bartender. Luckily, he made himself useful and actually got the channel changed but not after asking the other patrons which were more than obliging but then he told us that he would have to ask his manager...huh? Five minutes previous, he said that if the other patrons were OK with it then he would change it...now, we had to wait for his manager to approve? I thought restaurants were all about hospitality seeing that their business is contingent upon their patrons happiness and satisfaction. It was clear how our dinner experience was going to be after this....\n\nSo, we did this dance for about twenty minutes until we were asked what we wanted to order....He got the gnocchi and I ordered the Sea Bass....I inquired about an ingredient in the Sea Bass that I wasn't familiar with and instead of telling me he didn't know what it was, the bartender made up some lame answer about the ingredient. He told me it was something like a \""crustini\"". I'm no trained chef, but I know my way around a kitchen and have a good concept about tastes and ingredients. Not being satisfied with his answer, I googled it and low and behold, it was NOTHING like a crustini but an ingredient that included pork....huh? Do the servers in this place not know anything about the food? What a wasted disappointment. And unfortunately, we can't agree with the Banana Cream Pie either....bake sale banana cream pie would've be comparable. \n\nWorst service that we have experienced in a very long time. To be housed at the great MGM Grand, I would've expected better. I think we would've had a better experience at the food court. \n\nThe food was passable.....not good...not great and definitely what I would've expected from Emeril. I'm not going to waste more time and energy by going on a continued rant but I will say that every minute I sat in Emeril's establishment was a waste of my life. \n\nThe BFF's two cents on the experience? \""Douchy bartenders, slow service, no eye contact, food was meh, banana cream pie lacked flavor-tasted nothing like cream and overpriced\"". Sums it up completely,	negative
They were a little slow tonight.  Most people do not need a review of this place, you have either eaten here or have been told to.  Only 1 other fast food burger in Vegas better than this one.	positive
I hate to be \""that person\"" that gives this place 2 stars. Finally made it here for their famed Sunday Jazz Brunch. Perfect time of year to sit outside and enjoy the weather, while brunching. Brunch is my favorite meal. Sit me outside overlooking a gorgeous golf course and waterfall, doesn't get any better.\n\nWe were greeted by our friendly waiter and drink orders taken. He explained that we have the choice of buffet style as well as some entree items to order. There were 4 of us so we decided to order a few items off the entree menu to share. \n\nEggs Versailles-these were ok, nothing special.\n\nWagyu Hot Dog- don't ask, we just figured, why not. Again, nothing special, it was just a hot dog.\n\nBread Pudding French Toast- I was most excited about this, but the bottom was hard as a rock. You should be able to eat french toast without using a knife. \n\nSo we moved onto the buffet station. We all started out with the crab legs. These were so salty, 3 bites in and i couldn't even finish a leg. My friend agreed. Either they boiled them with way too much salt in the water or they were frozen.\n\nI tried the Shrimp & Grits, these were my favorite item. They were really good.\n\nThe buffet station was really small. They had some Kumiai oysters, some peel and eat shrimp, ceviche as well as build your own bagel and lox. Some granola parfaits, as well as a small cheese/salami board. And a very small dessert area. I didn't take part in the carving station. \n\nFor $65 a person, I expected a lot more. At least better food. I don't need an enormous selection, but at least make the food offered taste good. \n\nThey do offer bottomless mimosas for $25.\n\nFor the Wynn, I was disappointed. I enjoyed the brunch at La Cave ten fold over this place.	negative
Ballet Arizona has certainly improved thanks to the Dane Anderson...what does\n interest me is he....a.gay man?  Inquiring minds want to know...& I dont know why its  such a big secret! ?Arent MOST guys in ballet? Is it ONLY me who is wondering?	positive
I was given a gift card for CafePino from a co-worker who just raved about the place. So I figured that I would give it a try.\n\nA warm Tuesday night, I found the place pretty much empty even though lots of people were milling around and heading to the movies.\n\nGrabbed a seat outside and cruised through the menu. I would not really call this place cheap by any means\n\nI ordered the Pizza Procuitto and where the flavor was nice, the Procuitto looked more like Canadian Bacon. It was not thin at all... When I asked the waiter if this was normal he said no... yet did not do anything to rectify the issue.\n\nI might give it another try... but only because I still have some money left on the gift card.	negative
We've been trying out Cosmo dog park for a few years now. We actually took a break for about a year, though, because the park was always so disgusting that one of my dogs was getting skin infections on his feet after each visit. We also had a ton of problems with smaller-dog owners not watching their dogs and being generally really stupid with their animals, endangering both their own dog and mine. More than once I had dogs who were unknown to me run straight for me and leap into my arms to escape being chased by a larger dog. Sad when the dogs come to me and not their owners!\n\nI did talk to the town parks people about the small-dog issue, kids playing in the lake with the dogs (eeeeewwwwww!) and other issues, and they told me about their plans for the park. They do now have the timid dog area in place and more trash bins. Since we now have a second, younger dog, we decided to try it again this past week. \n\nMy dogs really liked the exercise and playtime, but the park is still really gross with dog crap everywhere. I didn't see a single person other than me pick up after their dog the entire time we were there. The small dog area gets used and I didn't see many issues with the little ones, so that was positive. But I am very concerned about health problems; both of our dogs got major soapy baths when we got home from the park. The parvo outbreak is significant this year and I don't think we'll chance going back. \n\nI also don't think people should be bringing their little kids to the dog park- there was even at least one family there with a baby and NO DOG. One guy made a comment as I walked by that \""now she won't ever be afraid of dogs!\"" Some of the dogs were literally nearly as big as me, and I saw some near-stroller-misses and some scary things for the kids- you may as well leave your baby sitting in the middle of the running of the bulls. \n\nCosmo is rated the best dog park in the country, and it could really be that if it was clean and if people had more common sense. It's not the dogs that are the problem....	negative
They did a good job on my pedicure but me and my sister both got a manicure and hers was sloppy while mine was crooked on a few fingers. It cost me a fortune and took forever. Everyone was nice there but to me it just wasn't worth it to spend my hard earned money on crooked nails. To boot they had a sign out front saying $25 for a full set but then charged me and my sister 35-45 each.	negative
Unfortunately no matter if I go to the galleria or Fashion Show it is the worst costumer service.  I was looking at a 600.00 Michael Kors handbag (at Fashion Show) with 3 sales associates talking and they never even looked at me. The whole store was like this.I bought nothing. I went to another department store and spent my money there. It's been like this for years. Especially the Galleria. I'd like to give a customer service training class. My guess is no one would show up.	negative
Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalape\u00f1o pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)	positive
Poor poor place of business	negative
As I sit a the gate 3, Terminal 2, UA1507 PHX-SFO in the plane with a 90 minute \""SFO Flow Control\"" and \""Mechanical problem of rivets missing on the engine cone?!\""  delay, I write this review. \n\nSky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.	positive
Culinary Dropout is a fun spot for dinner and drinks with a group of people.  Everyone loves the pretzels and fondue appetizer, though I find it overrated.  The house potato chips are impressive though!  \n\nIt never fails that someone will order the fried chicken, and I'm not sure why it's never been me.  This restaurant is good at comfort food... the meatloaf is worth trying, I've heard great things about the burger, and I love the kale and sweet potato salad.  \n\nSome of the speciality cocktails are pretty good, albeit overpriced.  I stick to some house wine and I'm never disappointed.  Like all Fox Restaurants, their iced tea is lovely.\n\nMake a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, so you avoid a wait.  Then kick back, enjoy some live music and good food in a lively astmosphere!	positive
Food was pretty good but the staff are a bunch of zombies walking around with absolutely no customer service let alone personality. Out bar tender Steven acted as if he was in hell and provided a borderline unpleasant experience do to how non personable he was.  Not to pick on Steven but this was a common trend with ALL the staff.... Not sure I'll come back again.  Try smiling guys!!!	negative
I really enjoy the vibe inside Giant Coffee.\nWide open, bright and airy space, with an attached boutique that is good for browsing before/after ordering coffee.\nI really enjoy the iced honey-vanilla latte. Great for someone who is not a fan of overly-strong coffee drinks. The baristas are always friendly and helpful.\nA great place to come and study. It seems the best place to hook up your laptop is on the south wall, where the cool space-agey desks are located. If you can get a seat there, you're in luck :)\nFresh flowers at each of the tables, always a highlight!\nParking is not an issue if you park across the street at CVS.\nMy only complaint? Stay open a little later! Phoenix needs late-night coffee hangout spots!	positive
This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.\n\nAs another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.\n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.\n\nPlaced our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.\n\nMy wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.\n\nWe were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.\n\n5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.\n\nWe will not be returning.	negative
I live just down Commonwealth and absolutely going to Common Market to get one of there deli sandwiches!  The Californian is my favorite.  They have a great wine and beer selection as well and have wine tastings and other events throughout the week!  Check 'em out!	positive
Loved the food and the atmosphere.\n\nSplit the Chicken Parm and Lemon Fresc with my girlfriend and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely have to come back soon.	positive
Wir warteten gestern 45 min bis jemand die Bestellung aufnahm. In der Zeit kamen auf unser Winken vier Mitarbeiter an den Tisch, die uns alle erkl\u00e4rten, dass es nicht ihr Bereich sei. Beim Bezahlen ging es auch ewig. Ganz klar gibt es am gleichen Ort L\u00e4den mit besserem Service.	negative
Called in a takeout order tonight & the process of ordering and going in to pick up was quick and painless. I could see parking being an issue for some, but that's just how it is downtown. Due to the small size of this place, I would probably only call in orders, but it's a really cute place. \n\nThe food was good and something I would try again. The Sweet Home Alabama was spicier than I expected, which was nice, but not as cheesy as I'd hoped. My husband got the Great Balls of Fire and he thought that it was good and the meatballs had a nice kick to them.  \n\nAll in all, a good experience. As someone who lives and works downtown, it's nice to have a new place that isn't pizza and is quick and easy to get takeout from.	positive
The 4-star rating is because of the taste.\n\nPrice:  150% of what you'd expect to pay\n\nService:  Excellent.  the service staff is friendly, smiley, and seem glad you're there.\n\nTaste:  absolutely wonderful.  The sauce is sweeter than most.\n\nI've only gone to the location south of Tempe Marketplace, and it seems kind of industrial.  I can EASILY overlook something like that for a lower price, so I'm ready for lower prices.	positive
I have been eating Thai food since 1983 when I was living and working in the region for years. I really never get the kind of taste experience in the U.S. yet I have had a good deal of excellent Thai in the bay area and elsewhere. But this place is obviously a cut above the rest.\n\nThe special spicy beef salad is amazing......they take an already excellent Yum Neua dressing and add hoisin sauce to create a masterful dressing like none other. It was killer.\n\nThe spicy chicken wing appetizer was also as good as I have had. We are madly in love with the same dish at Bangkok House in Kona and yet we thought this was even better....the sauce was richer and more garlic. Also a killer dish.\n\nLastly was the pineapple fried rice which has curry powder added as a twist....something not normally done in Thailand. The dish was perfect and so tasty.........but it was small and for the money they should be using fresh pineapple not canned. But it was still good enough no need to complain and even the curry powder was a nice touch.\n\nOur waiter \""Tea\"" is fantastic, great sense of humor.......and knows his stuff. Tea, if you read this thanks again for the tip on the special beef salad.\n\nCannot wait to go back.	positive
This place is pretty good! I wanted something decently healthy, cheap, and quick so I decided to try Jason's Deli. I got the turkey wrap and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I also got the broccoli cheddar soup which was delicious. The menu has a wide variety of food items to choose from which is great. Only downside - it was kind of pricey considering the amount of food I got. The wrap was realllllly small and wouldn't have satisfied me if thats all I got. However, overall, it was pretty good! Recommended!	positive
Enjoyed it even more on our second trip! Think it will be among our go-to bookmarked spots! The two item combo with rice is only $5.99 and is plenty for one... We each get one with different items and share. Love the BBQ pork!!	positive
Probably one of the best JC Penney's that I've been in a while.\n\nVery clean, and the staff is very friendly.  Never any lines, and well stocked and situated.  I think that the only issue with this store is its location which is tucked back behind Sears Grand.   Took us a while to find the first time since there wasn't any signs to designate where it was.\n\nYou know as they say... location location location.\n\nOtherwise, the place is great!	positive
Got the carne asada Jr. Burrito, it was dank! Although, it does suck to pay extra for things that are supposed to be included already. But besides that, Los Tacos was a party in my mouth.	positive
Just stopped in for some pizza and was so surprised they had white slices. I've been in AZ for 3 years and always miss good New York pizza. I would say their pizza is close to small chain pizzerias if you want a good New York slice try garden pizza in Goodyear but if you want a close to New York small chain \""Mario's pizza\"" style pizza an need a white slice fix give Gus a try. Got a special surprise the chef made some tiramisu and let us try it. Absolutely fantastic	positive
