Probably the best show we've seen so far! It's really worth it, nice theater built especially for this and the show is amazing! Try to not seat in the first 3 rows, you'll get wet. You can get drinks and popcorn, but they are pretty expensive.	positive
Dr. Amy is the BEST! She made me feel like family and took care of me and my dental situation. I did not go out of there in tears like my last dentist. Her front office staff Karla was understanding and very helpful.\nThank you Dr. Amy and your staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome.	positive
I've been here a few times and let me tell you it's been a great experience in every visit, one of my two favorite appetizers is the nachos with carne Asada and the chorizo with queso, I could just keep coming back for these two,along with a beer at their newly added bar which by the way the variety it's pretty awesome, they have all kinds of tequilas you just wanna try them all haha! I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!	positive
We've started making Eddie's House a regular friday routine. Tonight he had Lebanese specials made by his mama. The stuffed squash and green beans in tomato sauce were awesome. My kids swear by the mac and cheese and they love the spices on the flatbread.	positive
This is my home course. I play here about 75 times a year. Recently they had a management change. For some reason  they forgot about the golfers who supported them when times were tough. The changes that they are making are great for the course. Just remember the local guys are the one replacing divots, spending money in the restaurant and making a effort to support you guys even when you burn the greens or the fairways on 13. If you keep up your changes, the locals we will find another place to play. Now with that being said the course is playing well. There has been some new ways of keeping the course in good condition. They are mowing early and raking the bunkers. This has helped them  become more consistent. The layout is fair for every golfer. There's not much trouble and even errant shots are forgiven by desert surrounds and lack of trees. Take your wedges because it is generally driver,short iron wedge type course. The front has a little water but bring your gas mask. All in all I would rate Rhodes a 5 out if 10. Worth at the most for 18 holes $30 to $45 a round. A great practice course at best. Lessons are great and are complementary for players club on Saturday with Alex (no longer with this course on the time it took to post this review)He is great with kids. Steer clear of Don or anyone who came from Tuscany. They are full of themselves. I am a resident of Rhodes Ranch and I am very disappointed with the last 4-6 months. Arnold Palmer would not be proud.	negative
I am genuinely the most easiest person to please. I always drove past this location and asked myself, \""Why have I NOT tried this place yet?\"" \n \nWe stood in line waiting to order and there was this elderly women in front of us who obviously was trying her best to take an order being it was her first time too, the cashier lady immediately got frustrated and scold the lady to pick up the tone of her voice because she couldn't hear her order.  \nIf that wasn't rude enough a drive thru asked for her assistants and she snapped at them telling them that she's occupied, \""Hold Up!\""\n\nThen it was my turn to order. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and did my best to order... I decided on a medium burger, and she rudely told me... \""you mean the beef medium burger?\"" Long story short because I don't want to write an essay...\n\nIf she didn't love her job find a new one... or if she was having a bad day? Take a moment to go and breath. There should be no reason for her to mistreat her guest. Especially when you never know who that guest could be. \n\nFood came out, we noticed she missed a lot of things we requested.... disappointed because the food was actually tastey.	negative
They have great pizza and now have a new menu.  I tried the Lasagna and being Italian I never ate one better than mine until I had their's.  I had to tell the chef.  They also have a stracciatella soup which is an egg drop soup (not on the menu) and it is delicious.  The other friends I was with loved the meals they ordered	positive
The hotel is small but yet very new and comfortable. I loved how clean it was and their customer service is amazingly good. They have a free shuttle to and from the strip and the airport too. I would definitely stay here again. I only paid $210.00 from September 3rd to the 6th. Cristian, one of their staff members, was amazing. He was always on top of everything and always willing to help. I loved the fact that although their staff was young, they were always happy, smiling and willing to help. Excellent work guys.	positive
How stupid are the supervisors of this airport? They have small shuttles to get you between terminals. The shuttles are very small buses that can not accommodate luggage. People who have to transfer from international to domestic usually have to grab their luggage and take it themselves. So no room in the shuttles. It is too far to walk. Stupid ignorant cheap supervisors. I can only assume that all the big buses were taken. Do us a favor and do something about that.	negative
If you want a fast but good burger that doesn't break the bank, leaving u money for other fun things! Really nice employees too!	positive
Read the reviews and couldn't wait to try this place.. that was my first mistake, I should have waited a long LONG time ;)\n\nFirstly, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall with some funky parking.  Went in, was impressed with the cleanliness and it certainly smelled wonderful.  Hubby was hungry, so he ordered the chips and dip, 2 garlic rolls, and a large pizza.. I quickly changed it to a small pizza, and I'm doubly glad that I did.\n\nChips and dip arrived - hubby thought they were both fantastic.  I thought they were good, but hardly \""life altering\"".  The chips are homemade, no salt on them, and fried until hard.  They're too thick to be called crispy.  The dip was called Ranch and it was all you tasted.. Ranch dressing.  If there were other seasonings in there, they were lost.\n\nThen the pizza arrived, and we reminded the guy about our garlic rolls.  He quickly returned with 2 foil wrapped rolls.  Hubby opened his and tasted it immediately.. then set it down and never picked it up again.  He said it was cold and boring, so I didn't open mine at all - not going to waste time on something that bad.\n\nThe pizza toppings were fresh and the crust was crispy.  Not thin, not thick, but sturdy.  However, the sauce had virtually no seasonings to it - a frozen pizza generally has more flavor than this did.  There was a shaker of oregano and another of garlic located with the shakers of pepper flakes and dried parmesan cheese.. once those were added, then it was okay.  I have serious issues with a pizza that has to be seasoned afterwards.. isn't that the cook's job?\n\nI had one slice, hubby had two.. and we tossed half the small pizza as not worth saving.\n\nOn a plus note, the fountain coke tasted great ;)	negative
I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place.	negative
This was the best buffet we ate at on our trip to vegas. the dessert bar was awesome here.	positive
WHOO HOO! Came to visit from out of town and was looking for something to do. Consulted \""the yelp\"" and found out about this place. Checked the website and found out there were Church Bus races that night. SOLD!\n\nThis was my first time doing anything like this and it was fantastic! We paid $7 each for entry, plus we did it up and got ourselves some Bud tallboys to complete the experience. The engines were loud, the crowd was rowdy, and the bathrooms were clean. What else could you want out of your night?	positive
I guess this would be an okay place to eat if you're leaving the Social Security office down the block and are literally about to die of old age and want to have one last gyros sandwich before you go. But otherwise, meh.\n\nWe had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.\n\nThe service was friendly and the dining room was bright, spacious and sunny - and the presence of a coffee bar is definitely a plus - but I won't be back.	negative
After reading my review the owner Dave contacted me. He was very professional and apologetic about what had happened and refunded my deposit. He didn't try to convince me that I was wrong but simply admitted that what had happened was unacceptable. It's not often that you get this kind of follow up service from any business so big props to Dave.	positive
Love that it's open 24 hours perfect for when we're craving donuts which Is often. I feel that if I wasn't allergic to milk we'd be coming here more often	positive
The food is great poblano chicken sandwhich great taste. Beer is cold!!! So here is my best advice try the place BEER IS COLD, Great atmosphere, girls are beautiful. But, it's the food you come for!! Remember this if the food isn't right service is sub par ask for a manager. Justin thanks for asking me to stay for the food!! Jamie you were great!!!!!	positive
My hubby and I are picky about our sushi. Many claim to be sushi spots, but they lack the culture that we look for in a sushi restaurant. Some chains have tried to make sushi hip, cool, and corporate,by pushing out the culture that invented it in the first place. Atami is authentic, JAPANESE, sushi, and it is oh so tasty, and reasonably priced. The spot is owned by a friendly Japanese couple. The husband handles the sushi right behind the sushi bar. \n\nLOCATION\nThis spot is a hole in the wall location right next to a SUBWAY and some independent businesses. Boo on you if you let the location deter you, and you chicken out and you opt for SUBWAY! Where is your sense of adventure? You are missing out. Some of the best food comes from these types of locations.\n\nRESTAURANT\nBefore you walk in, you'll see their \""A\"" Grade proudly posted in their window for everyone to see. An \""A\"" Grade is more than enough reason to set my foot in the door!!! It is very neat and clean. The restaurant is tiny. It is sit down, or take out. It has a sushi bar where you can see how your food is prepped. It also has booths and tables.\n\nFOOD\n\nYou can order sushi and other Asian dishes from the menu, and they are reasonably price. This is not an easy find. Sushi is often overpriced. One of the highlights of this location is the Bento Special. The Bento Special includes your choice of an entree that comes with soup, rice, 4 California Roll pieces, and a Spring Roll for 6.99. You can tack on their 2 sushi roll combo for an additional $7. The food is fresh and is served on something that is not your traditional white plate. At this location presentation matters.\n\nThe menu is nice, but the highlight of this location is the sushi. The sushi is the first thing that you should try. I heart Atami and you should too!!!! Support this local business YELPERS. This place needs to be around because it is legit, and it is oh so tasty.	positive
This review has to do with just trying to give STK business.  I've being trying to reach them for 2 days to book a private room for 12 people.   When restaurants are hot and booked every night they think they are untouchable.  This attitude/arrogance is pathetic!  They will not always be on top and when their appeal declines people will remember how they were treated.  Good Luck STK!	negative
Great tasting sweet potato fries. Music is way too loud. Burger is large but very greasy. Bun was greasy, and double patty fat had soaked into bun. Way over priced at $11.50.  Next time it's McDonalds!	negative
By far the best rendition of NY Style pizza in Charlotte.  This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. Although we live closer to the Ballantyne we will go there next week. \n\nWe just had a pizza with bacon and it was perfect.  They use good cheese,  an excellent sauce and perfectly crumbled bacon. \n\nGood atmosphere for kids too n	positive
As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.	positive
Wow what a cool place. Inside you'll find a vast selection from all over the world of imported olive oils, vinegars, pesto, tapenades, appetizers, marinades, sauces, dressings, mustards, specialty salts, exotic herb mixes and much more. They also have several handcrafted ceramics and culinary accessories to make you feel like you are the King or Queen of the kitchen.\n\nThe friendly staff here is extremely knowledgeable and more than happy to share what they know. History of the product, how it is made, cooking tips, as well as providing a giant array of tasty items to sample. We tried several of the oils along with all the yummy vinegars on their display table. They even have spicy HOT sauces. Nice!\n\nHad to get a bottle of the fantabulous Cherry Almond Balsamic Vinegar that we all enjoyed while sampling. They say you can even put it on Cheese Cake or Ice Cream.\n\nThey also offer custom labels personalized for your special occasion such as weddings, corporate events, employee appreciation, etc. Hmmm?\n\nDefinitely plan on coming back again. YES!\n\n4.5 STARS	positive
Today at around 3:30 PM, i walked into this store where they were about 10 partons in the store. One of the clerks said \""Hi, hows it going today\"", i said 'fine, but i'm about to get busy'. He notices my recently rescued puppy sitting in my car. He then yells out that he can see the heat rising over my dog's head, then this clerk says he (or someone) is going to break out my car windows\""??? I replied 'that i'm going to break you\"" and some other words if he does that. By then i'm angry, or maybe embarrassed, since my car windows were down ...and i had a friend in the car with her, as well, and i'm only in that store for maybe 5 minutes. I'm angry because this is the 2nd time this clerk has made a comment that's pretty hostile about my dog, so this time i wanted to talk to him about how this makes me feel. The other clerk,  Robert Vassos, then begins to YELL at the top of his voice at me about wanting to address this clerk (all i said to that clerk was \""you hurt my feelings\"") while he pushes him away, he's telling me to leave the store,, don't come back and a few other nasty words. I remained calm but i flipped him off and licked my tongue out at him (i know, very childish) with a smile on my face as i exited the store, not sure what else i said before that moment. He thens runs behind me yelling out the door \""screw you and your dog!!\""??  I flipped him off again, something i NEVER, EVER do, even in traffic, or at anyone, for that matter but i needed to fight back at this point since both of them had become hostile towards me by then??\n\n I'm a 4th generation Nevadan Grandpa worked on Boulder Dam, my dad owned packaged liquors in the Midwest after his years as a professional football player. I've never seen such crazy hostile reactions being it was their clerk that started this with me by making threats about vandalizing my car when i walked into their store? The reasons i became so concerned now was that the other many patrons might decide to attack me or my car, thinking i was doing what he had accused me of doing to my puppy?? I'm a hybrid driving vegan that lives a sustainable lifestyle but i dont run around in grocery stores YELLING at customers because they choose to eat meat or drive gas guzzling cars,, yet this clerk is yelling at me about my furrychild based on paranoid delusions?? \n\n In the past, all the other clerks have been extremely nice but this clerk needs reevaluation and should keep his hostile, paranoid thoughts to himself; that manager needs anger management before he hurts someone. thank you!	negative
So what's the big deal here and, based on the experiences I've had coupled with a lot of the other Yelp reviews I've read, how are they still open?\n\nCute decor? Definitely. Funky?  Certainly. Hip? I suppose. All that does not a restaurant destination make though.\n\nThe food sounds nice on the menu and the fact they are supporting local farms and growers is appreciated but the results are just so uneven. It tastes good but it's cold, it's hot but overcooked, it's hot and cooked properly but really doesn't taste quite right. It's perfectly prepared and delicious. Who can tell?\n\nAdd to that the fact that the front of the place is a disorganized mess and the staff is either surly or outright rude and condescending and I get back to my original sentiment. How is this place still open?	negative
Although I like the concept of the place, it was seriously lacking in customer service.  In addition, the bartenders don't even know enough to tell you what different types of beer they have.  I don't care what your selling, you should at least have some knowledge about your product.	negative
Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing  fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500$ \n\nHorrible customer service and untrained staff. \n\nI proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing!\n\nI'm also reporting this store to the BBB.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!	negative
I have been going to this office for a few years, and for some reason I have never thought to review them on yelp. Weird.\n\nAnyway, the front office staff is friendly enough. I can usually get an appointment within a day or 2. I was unique with some of the paperwork I had to provide for my school, and the office was always extremely accomodating with short notice or allowing me to pick up a note without an appointment, or just calling up and explaining what the school needed and they would call me when it was readt, etc etc\n\nI recommend Dr. Whipple. He is super nice. He spends time with you to answer all your questions. And, being a nurse, I find him thorough. There have, also, been a few times where I asked for a certain test to be done, and he will order it.\n\nI, also, like that there are some things done onsite, which is convenient...such as X-rays and ultrasounds.\n\nThe negatives for me are they weigh you in the hallways out in front of everyone. And, I just feel like, for a lot of people, this might be something they want to keep private. They, also, close early on Fridays...I think at 3:30p.\n\nAlso, the last time I was there I left a class an hour early so I would be on time and arrived at 3:15 for a 3:30 appointment. I did not get called to the exam room until 4:30. Then I waited another 30 minutes for the doctor to actually see me. I didn't end up leaving until 5:30. I had to cancel dinner reservations for 6:30 because of this. And, NO ONE apologized. Totally unacceptable. I was beyond irritated. What was weird is there were only  of us waiting to be seen by various docs...so it wasn't like they were crazy busy.\n\nLastly, pray you never need your medical records because Jacqueline in that department will do everything in her power to not give them to you. I called on April 1st and faxed my signed request. I got no response for a week, so I called to get a status update. I was told my request was never received even though I had my successful fax confirmation. I refaxed my request on April 22 then called to confirm it was received. I tried explaining that I was working with a deadline from my insurance company, and because my 1st request allegedly wasn't received, now I had even less time. For whatever reason, this passed Jacqueline off. I honestly can't think of another instances where someone was this mean on the phone...seemingly for no reason. It was indicated to me in so many words, that because she could make me wait, she would make me wait. As of May 13...still no records. Thanks, Jacqueline!!	negative
I was also in the group of four from the below review. The service was beyond absurd. Ordering four drinks in a pub that is moderately busy shouldn't take over half an hour. Our 'waitress' took 15 minutes of that to even come and greet the table. \n\nAfter ordering we sat and watched new customers come in and sit at the bar, promptly receiving service and drinks. All the while, our waitress would stand at the bar and drink her own drink, watch the football game or just completely disappear into the back. At first, I thought she was waiting on the bar, but the bartender wasn't busy, as he spent most of his time standing and talking. \n\nFinally our drinks came. The whiskey was an issue, plus the cider was flat and tasted horrible. Alas, the waitress was nowhere to be seen for over 10 minutes and by the time she re-appeared, we were ready for our bill and wanted to leave.\n\nThe staff here seems to be lacking training and some sort of management. I can't believe a table of four, who would have stayed for more drinks, can't get more than one round in 45 minutes. The entire staff seemed more interested in socializing with each other and watching tv than any kind of service.\n\nIf I'm going to spend 8.50 on a beer, I'll be going somewhere that I can at least get more than one, and won't taste like the keg isn't cold and a couple months past it's expiry.	negative
I just came back from here. The drive thru was crazy, of course because of the time (1130). \n\nThere was a young employee setting up an umbrella and a sign. He was the ONLY one who was nice, which you would think, in this heat, he would be a little snappy.\n\nThe other two employees I greeted, said \""hello\"" to, asked them how they were. No response.\n\nUnreal. But my order was right.	negative
Previously known as Imperial Palace is good because of its location on the strip. Smacked in the center and cheap. But, you get what you're paying for, and sometimes less. I've stayed here many times because of comp rooms and because it's just convenient. Here's what I've learned:\n\n(1) self-parking is a pain. People take up 2 spots and do not even pay attention to the lines. On top of that, the spots are all compact. If you drive a big car, don't bother. Your options? Valet or park at Harrah's. Harrah has a walkway over to The Quad from the parking structure and there's much more spaces at Harrah's parking lot.\n\n(2) Front desk ALWAYS has a line. Be ready to wait to check-in. As for checking out, do it from the TV. Save you time from standing in line again.\n\n(3) Always ask for a room in the lowest floor possible. Elevator here is a drag. Better off taking the stairs.\n\n(4) NEVER stay in Tower 5. This is right next to the Outdoor club and music will be blasting!\n\n(5) $5 blackjack tables are available early morning and ends around 10AM. \n\nAnd that's 5 things you need to know about Imperial.. I mean The Quad, folks!	negative
