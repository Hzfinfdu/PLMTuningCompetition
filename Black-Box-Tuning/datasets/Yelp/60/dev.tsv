I attended the mothers day brunch here as part of Vegas Uncorked 09'. It was hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. I find myself daydreaming about it constantly. All of the food was served family style and was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed every single dish that was served but the dishes that stood out the most to me were the pork belly and wagyu skirt steak. DROOL!The service was top notch. The waiters kept the unlimited champagne and mimosas flowing.  And they were happy to get us additional servings of the dishes if we wanted more. My table went through a lot of the pork belly. It was awesome to see Tom Colicchio and get an autographed cookbook that included recipes of some of the items we ate that day. I definitely recommend this place and can not wait to go back!	positive
My husband, 3 year old daughter and I ate at Renegade last nite with another couple.  We hade been meaning to go for months and I am glad we finally made it.  I am always a little aprehensive to go to a new place with my daughter since I never know if the atmosphere would be good for kids or not.  Is this a place you can let your kids run around in? No However, they have a greta kids menu and give the kids a cactus coloring sheet and crayons.  The atmosphere has a good vibe and a nice buzz.  (I don't frequent quiet places with my 3 year old so this was great).  \n\nThe restaurant is really beautiful. I was surprised how busy it was at 6:30 (full, as was the bar)\n\nWe had a variety of dishes starting with the green chili pork stew and tortillas as an appetizer. This was amazing!  I could seriously go back for dinner again and have this as my meal. Everyone loved it.\n\nOther dishes we had:\n*  Filet Mignon - This had great flavor and was a good cut of meat. The mashed potatoes that came with it were just OK (I am picky when it comes to these)\n* Burger - HUGE. way too big to eat without a knife and fork.  It was REALLY good. I am not a big sauce person and I even liked the sauce that came on it (maybe a chipotle mayo or something like that) Skinny fries were delish.\n* Green chili mac and cheese - this was soooooo yummy! You can actually order a small side. We did just to taste it and I am glad we did. Really yummy and the texture was great with the combo of soft noodles and toasty bread crumbs.\n* Caesar salad - fresh, crips greens - a little (just enough) garlic. This was topped with jalapeno croutons and they were great.\n* Pot Roast - I didn't try it but my friend loved it\n* Roasted Chicken - Again, didn't try this but it got rave reviews.  I saw several people eating this while we were there as well.\n* Bread pudding - this was really great - and it has some sort of rare mushroom in it that gives it the caramel/maple flavor. yum!\n* My daughter had the vanilla ice cream (I wasn't sure if it was ice cream or gelato but it was home made and delish!)\n\nWe will definitely be back to Renegade.	positive
After attending a nearby Yelp event, a few yelpers decided it was time for a burger. I heard Bobby Flay, burgers and beer....I was sold! \n\nI was instantly impressed with the layout of this joint. The tables were in a semi \""S\"" shaped style, which made for interesting dining. The tables were large and held about 10 people. The entire setup of the restaurant was fun and creative. No one walked away from our table a stranger. \n\nThe line was long but went quickly. We waited less than 5 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we placed our order. I approached the cashier knowing exactly what I wanted. I was quick to order and to pay. \n\nThe Bill: $22.16.....ehhh\n\nThe Brunch Burger - certified Angus beef, fried egg, smoked bacon and American cheese. I like my meat a little pink to keep the flavor so I ordered medium. The burger was nicely cooked but on your typical sesame seed bun. The egg and bacon was amazing, really who could argue with a fried egg and smoked bacon?? The burger was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  Not sure it was worth the $9.50, but I knew walking in I was paying for the name behind the burger. \n\nThe Half and Half - you can order one side for $4 each or combine 2 sides for $5. You have the option to get french fries, sweet potato fries or beer battered onion rings. I decided to go for the the regular fries, with the all amazing BBP Fry Sauce and the Beer Battered Onion Rings. The fries were tasty, crisp and all around the perfect fries. No complaints. I was a little disappointed to only see 2 onion rings come with the half and half. I mean really, those rings were perfect and you're going to tease me with only 2? \n\nBeer - Miller Lite. Yes, BBP has its own decent selection of beers, drinks, wines spiked milkshakes and margaritas, I stuck to my roots and went with a Miller Lite. After all, they didn't have PBR. \n\nOverall, the food was good but nothing about it stood out to make my mouth water as I write my review. The staff checked on us regularly and even made sure we all had beers when we were getting low. Just because of the experience, friendliness of the staff and my urge to try more burgers on the menu, I will probably return.	positive
Extremely enjoyable place with a warm atmosphere, fantastic Bloody Mary, great beer and whiskey selections	positive
When it comes to getting a pet a fish is usually the standard place to start.  They offer admittedly only a mild amount of entertainment, but it does offer a cheap test of your commitment to caring for a very undemanding living being.  You may even grow to love fish and their simple nature that never tires of going up and down the same old stretch of water.\n\nHaving decided to get a fish you simply must come here as it can't be matched by anything you get elsewhere.  The range is simply unbelievable and despite this the prices are very good.  This is the one stop fish shop.	positive
Firefly...you finally made it to Hendertucky! It's always busy, which is a sign of great food and they never split large party checks which is a sign of laziness BUT...the place never leaves me disappointed and always leaves me craving more.	positive
The M Resort reached out to me and offered me a complimentary buffet meal. I don't live near Henderson,NV Like I am going to drive all the way back from Southern California just for a buffet meal. Unbelievable.	negative
I love Trader Joes!! Living downtown has turned me into a 2+ times a week shopper of TJs. I love how cheap and unique everything is. The staff is friendly, like really friendly, like they cant wait to get out of bed and sell groceries . TJ has all of the staples of my life for a great price; hummus, produce, meat, cheese, and WINE. \n\nOnly have 2 small complaints. One is parking (at the Met location). I have solved this by parking across king street in the big empty lot and taking the crosswalk over to the Met. Second, sometimes it takes a LONG time to check out. I think this has something to do with the uber friendliness of the staff. And please, for Christ Sake, start bagging your things as they are checking you out.	positive
I thought about giving Paisan's just one star but decided the amazing view was worth another. I'll start by saying that there probably isn't another restaurant in Madison with such a prime, waterfront location.\n\nAnd that's a huge shame because the food here is no good. It's supposedly Italian, but less authentic (and less tasty) than Olive Garden. The dishes are so plain - why should I go out to eat to order spaghetti in tomato sauce? Sure, at a really good Italian place simple works well, but here the food really does not taste professional at all. Pizza is the easiest thing in the world to make taste amazing yet at Paison's it is so mediocre. It probably says something about the kitchen's culinary expertise that the menu boasts a ham sandwich with banana peppers as the restaurant's most famous item.\n\nI would only say go here if you must, must eat on the water downtown. Even then, I would probably rather get food at the terrace or something.	negative
I had high hopes, but i was not impressed. this is the first show i started falling asleep with. It came with my hotel when we stayed there. It had high flying acrobatics with water. the performers come from the roof hooked to cable. I didn't really hate it i just wasn't impressed. Glad i didnt have to pay for it.	negative
My wife and I want to Geno's because our usual (and favorite place) Venezia's was packed.  To be honest, we should have waited at Venezia's.\n\nWe each had a slice and split the Greek Salad.  The pizza was horrible, reminded me school lunch pizza.  The dough at Geno's tasted frozen and looked unappetizing when I lifted up to look at the bottom.  \n\nWe will not be back and wouldn't recommend this place to others.	negative
Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.	negative
My girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \""last call\"" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.  \n\nWhen the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.	negative
xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area\n wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for.	positive
I have thought about writing this review for a while and have finally decided to get out. I have been with this practice for over three years now and the service has consistently declined. Within the past year the time it takes to even make appointments has increased to 15min of waiting on hold just to then have them tell you that they don't have any appointment times open that will suit your schedule for at least two weeks. I have not seen the same physician each time I have visited in the past year and only one time have I received courteous service. If you want to be able to see the doctor in a timely manner and have the staff at least seem like they care about you consistently, then South Point Family Practice is not the place for you.	negative
We live on Montreal and this is one of our favorite breakfast spots. We always recommend our friends and guests go here when in town.\nSide of French toast, an ABSOLUTE must!!!	positive
Just to be clear, when they say a side of meatballs, pasta and red sauce, they really mean pasta with red sauce and a meatball.	negative
Rockin' Taco is located on the second floor.  The bar overlooks the strip.  Bf and I sat at the bar and grabbed food from the adjacent station.  I ordered a salad with beef and guac.  The staff was stingy with the ingredients.  The quesadilla was okay.  Meat was $2 extra and there was also a $2 extra charge for the guac.  Meat is low grade and is tough.\n\nBartender was shady.  She hit on my bf once when I went to get food and another time when I went to the restroom.	negative
My girlfriend and I planned our trip to Vegas down to the minute.  We left nothing to chance and did extensive research.  It was her first trip to Vegas (I had been before) and besides, she's a planner.  So when looking into nightclubs, we wanted to find 2, one for Friday and one for Saturday, that we HAD to see, and then one or two more to go to after if it turned out the first wasn't all it was cracked up to be or if we just wanted to check out something else.\n\nFriday night was XS and we were disappointed.  We left after 90 minutes or so and headed to The Act, which we loved.  Our second night was going to be an \""off-strip\"" night.  Firstly, we wanted to check our as many rooftop lounges and clubs for comparison, and between Rio and Palms, there's like 3 or 4.  And in our research, Voodoo looked like the best, so our first club Sat was Voodoo, and our backup was Ghostbar in Palms.  We never left Voodoo.\n\nFirstly, you have to start with the view.  Voodoo has 2 outdoor levels, and both have fantastic views.  We were there in mid April, so the weather was perfect.  The inside of the club was nice - maybe not the fanciest or coolest place, but it was upscale.  Dance floor was a bit small.  Regardless, there was no one inside - why would you be for a place like this.  When you could dance to great music and those views, it makes for a great night.\n\nSecond, music.  This is the type of music I want to hear.  Top 40, hip hop, dance.  Not house.  Mix some house in if you must to show off your DJ skills, but stick to what people like to listen to.  Admittedly, this was an older crowd and I think we (I'm 35) prefer top 40 over house music.  But you can dance to it, sing to it, and just have fun.  The only strange thing with the music was that the DJ for the lower outdoor level was playing the same songs as the upper level DJ, just maybe an hour or so behind.  I'm not sure if that was intentionally, but my girlfriend and I were on the upper level for a couple of hours, but then had an issue with another patron, so we decided to walk down the outdoor stairs to the lower level (it's only one floor down - still practically rooftop).  We got down there, and heard maybe half a dozen or so songs that we had heard upstairs earlier in the evening.  So that was strange.\n\nOur only problem was old people who can't handle their liquor.  There was some woman there, having fun, and dancing like there was no one around her.  Head and arms flailing all over the place.  Voodoo didn't get nearly as crowded as the other clubs - there was a crowd, but there was room to dance and move around - but regardless, club goers, you have to be aware of your surroundings.  Show a little restraint in your spasms.  This drunk 40 some year old was throwing her arms around and knocked my girlfriends drink, hard, right out of her hands.  The drink hit the ground and splashed on at least 2-3 other people.  So while we're apologizing profusely to everyone else, this woman went on like nothing happened.  Thankfully, everyone around us understood and we didn't have a problem, but this idiot didn't even acknowledge what she did, much less replace my girlfriends drink.  So it put a damper on the night, but we still had fun.\n\nTherefore, if you're okay with a 30-40 year old crowd that forgot how to party, then you should absolutely go to Voodoo.  Besides XS and Act, my only other club experiences in Vegas were Rain at Palms, which is now closed, and Studio 54 at MGM, also closed, so I don't have many places to compare it to, but I think this has got to be one of the best.	positive
Alex and Ben are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Very helpful and understanding got a MVP from them and Ben sat with me and explained everything to me that I needed to know. Alex also helped my husband purchase and set up his new re build able one. the flavors are great our fav is M.S.G they are the best place in phx!!! I will not be going anywhere but here	positive
I work graveyard shift and order food from here 2-3 times a week. I have tried most of the menu and can't think of anything that I didn't like. The service is friendly and every time I call they remember me by name.	positive
My friend suggested I stay here while visiting her, since it was close to where she lives. The price considering the other resorts nearby seemed the best I could do financially, so I reserved a room here. No problems with the reservation, or check in. Nothing special really, and \""adequate\"" would be the best way to describe this place. They do have an outdoor pool for the kids. They also have a coffee bar along with bagels and some baked wrapped goods. Again nothing special and I understand that since I made the suggestion of having 2 pots of each coffee ready for guests, they are going to make that change. I noticed people behind me had to wait 10 minutes for a new pot to brew, and when you are in a hurry you don't want to wait that long.\nMy room consisted of a queen bed, a couch and tv and a little dining area of refrigerator with freezer, and some dishes and a small stove. I didn't cook anything while here so I can't comment on the stove.\nThe bathroom has a tub which I appreciated, however no shampoo is provided and I had to go down the following morning to request some. No conditioner is available either. Again, an adequate hair dryer IS provided which was nice to have since I didn't bring one. I didn't know this but they don't provide room service daily, only for people staying more then 7 days I believe. I requested more pillows the next morning, after a sleepless night of tossing and turning on my ironing board comfortable bed. When I returned that evening NON were provided. The next morning I went down to get a cup of coffee, but my coffee consisted of grinds. I told the manager at the front desk who led me back to where they brew the coffee, and got a fresh cup.\nI also explained how uncomfortable the bed was, and the pillows being so squishy they provided no  support whatsoever. He offered to have them flip the mattress over, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The pillows I requested WERE in the room by my return that evening.\nI probably would have to stay here again since it is fairly close to my friend, and not far from Scottsdale Blvd which is a major road for everything.  However, if I can find something around the same price, I wouldn't hesitate to go elsewhere.\nThe rooms are clean so no worry there, and the staff is very dedicated to trying to make your stay a good one so I can't fault them for that.\nHowever, I think they need to update their beds and pillows, because I am paying to sleep there, and would have loved a great nights sleep.	negative
Love the shrimp tacos here!!!	positive
I am very picky about breakfast and this place is phenomenal. Saw on Man vs. food and was in Vegas on vacation so we wanted to experience for ourselves. I don't usually indulge in biscuits with sausage gravy, but this one served over smashed potatoes was worth every single calorie! My other friends got different versions of hash and couldn't stop raving about it! Definitely worth the drive or cab ride off strip!	positive
This is one of our favourite restaurants in Phoenix.  We've been back numerous times, bringing family and friends, and it never fails to disappoint.  That's what keeps us coming back.  The service and food are always top notch.	positive
Food was subpar.  Clams were not fresh.  Service made up for a little bit of it.  Our waiter was really attentive.	negative
Ouch! I never wished I steped foot inside this bar. The female bartender seemed liked we were a nuisance in between her twitter updates. I wish I could get paid to update my social media status instead of serving my customers. Didn't even bother to stay to try the food. We left after one drink because of the poor service. It was not a pleasurable experience.	negative
I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.	negative
Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience.	positive
Checked into a room that was still being cleaned. Had to wait 20 minutes outside room for completion of cleaning only to find hair all over the bathroom. Very poor service and  service recovery.	negative
I was SO looking forward to eating at Modern Steak. A group of friends decided we should hit up Modern Steak for dessert, we were a large party, so we made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. We arrived and I was so impressed with the decor, I knew we were in for a treat. We were ushered  to a private room in the back. I was a little surprised at the set up, they had one long table set up for about 20-24 people (we were only a group of 15), and the only way to get from one side of the table to the other (or out of the room if god forbid you had to exit to use the restroom), was through a narrow, 12 inch space between the edge of the table and the glass wall. The wait staff quickly brought in our desserts, a selection of mini-cupcakes (my favorite), including carrot cake, banana, chocolate and of course red velvet. We attempted to make drink orders (I believe the wait staff took half of the table's drink orders), after asking the waiter for some wine recommendations, he said he would send the sommolier in. I think the sommolier came in with one person's wine. It was so chatotic it was hard to say what was going on. After 15 minutes, I had yet to even receive a glass of water, and did not get to start on my cupcakes until after asking several waiters (and getting dirty looks) for a glass of water. The cupcakes were the only thought that kept me going, I knew they were going to be worth it...what a giant let down. Save your money and whip up a batch of Duncan Hines Red Velvet cupcakes, they will be a HUNDRED times better. I doubt I will ever return to Modern Steak.	negative
Had a 430 appt. It's now 530. They said 20 more minutes. It's nice could use some upgrade to facility.  Overall service blah..Overbooked patients. I've been waiting for this second appt for them to advise me we may not get finished. What the heck, 3 appts for 3 cavity s ummm no its hard enough to schedule around work. After this we probably will not be back. Did I mention OVERBOOKED HURRY UP AND WAIT. NO GOOD PATIENT CARE. WE ARE NUMBERS.	negative
