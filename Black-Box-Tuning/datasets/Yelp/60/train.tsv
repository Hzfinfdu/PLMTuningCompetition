Waited over 10 minutes for a toasted bagel. Finally had to ask for it. It was cold and nobody cared or apologized. The excuse was someone was in break.  Won't return for awhile	negative
The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome. \n\nFondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.\n\nThe table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  \""WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY\"" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.\n\nWe had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was \""forbidden to go to\"" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.\n\nLove the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time.	positive
Update: 28.08.10\nAlso hier musste ich erst einmal eine Nacht dr\u00fcber schlafen. So einen Service habe ich wirklich selten erlebt. Schnippische (meiner Ansicht nach schlichtweg freche) Antworten auf normale Fragen, Wartezeiten vor (!) der Bestellung von mehr als 15min, Wartezeiten auf die Cocktails die ins unertr\u00e4gliche gingen (mehr als 20min) und nachdem dann mehr als 30-40min eine Gruppe von 12 Personen auf leere Gl\u00e4ser geschaut hat den Laden durstig und komplett frustriert verlassen. \nAuch das Aufssuchen des Diensthabenen h\u00e4tte ich mir sparen k\u00f6nnen, denn dieser hatte nur ein Grinsen f\u00fcr meine Beschwerde (sachlich) \u00fcbrig. Ich empfand das Verhalten als pers\u00f6nlich verletzend und wir sind uns nicht willkommen und st\u00f6rend vorgekommen. Der Laden war im Innenraum max. 25% gef\u00fcllt. \nIch habe wirklich schon sch\u00f6ne Abende im Taquito erlebt, aber die letzten Erfahrungen zwingen mich diese \u00d6rtlichkeit auch mit Gesch\u00e4ftspartnern nicht mehr aufzusuchen (die hier sehr gerne hingehen). Mit mir als Gastgeber werde ich mir so ein Peinlichkeit wie gestern nicht mehr geben. \nNur um meine Darstellung zu konkretisieren: Wir sind mit 12 (!) Personen um 22:30 (!) Uhr in das Lokal. Da in der Bar (logischerweise) f\u00fcr 12 (!) Personen kein Platz mehr war sind wir unter den Sombrero (gro\u00dfer runder Tisch). Direkt nach der Begr\u00fc\u00dfung durch den Kellner wurden wir sehr bestimmt darauf hingewiesen, dass der Barbereich vorne und hier der Restaurantbereich w\u00e4re. Nur Getr\u00e4nke g\u00e4be es vorne (wir konnten uns dann aber durchsetzen). Noch mal zum mitdenken - 12 Personen um 22:30 Uhr! Nun mal noch zum Thema Grundrechenarten: Was ist mehr? 2 Cocktails \u00e1 EUR 7,50 oder ein Buritto (EUR 9,90) + ein Pils f\u00fcr EUR 2,60 ?	negative
Not good, the stuff looks great but very dry and lacking in the flavor department. The only reason we stopped there was because our favorite bakery was closed and we wanted sweets. \nThe place is dirty as well, I didn't expect that from a shop in Summerlin.	negative
I have been here a few times before the Diner, Drive-ins and Dives over the yeart. The only item I have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich. I was there recently and had the meatball sandwich which I had such fond memories of enjoying and it was okay. So, if I am in the area, I will give it another try.\n\nAnd one more thing, the Guiseppe's on Scottsdale Rd did have better meat ball sandwiches.	negative
If I could give them 0 stars, that would make me happy!  I will never purchase anything from them ever again.  They do not have the products they list in their catalog and when you order them they do not deliver!  No customer service!  Not helpful!  I normally don't write reviews but they have made me so mad, I thought everyone should know how they treat their customers.	negative
Naturally I'm picky about Filipino restaurants because I'll always compare it to my mom-in-law or grandma's cooking. I have been to Thelma's twice and I was a happy customer both times.\n\nOn my first visit, I was ordered Kare Kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce) and Thelma's special. I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \""special\"" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.\n\nThe next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!	positive
This place is an amazing hidden gem I am so happy to find good pho and cold noodles out here I will definitely keep coming back	positive
A very good steakhouse that makes sure you leave patting your belly in satisfaction.  The atmosphere here is very dim, and there really isn't a 'fascinating' view of the strip from here, but the service is impeccable.  I haven't experienced anything negative from any of the employees here.  The hostesses are attentive and cordial, the waiters prompt and knowledgeable, and the chefs....well they know what they're doing.\n\nLike most steak houses this place offers a huge porterhouse (24 oz) along with your standard Rib eyes, and NY Strips.  Everything is cooked to the proper doneness that you ask for.  Dishes are served A la carte, so you do have to pay extra for that baked potato or fries to go with your meat.\n\nSpeaking of sides, Their garlic steak fries are a staple for me here.  yes I'm a potato lover, and these fries are actually more like logs.  They're a huge potato that's been quartered, then fried w/ garlic, seasoned, then served.  I recommend you use a fork and knife to chow it down, but nobody says you can't use your fingers too....it is a fry after all.\n\nThe appetizers are great too, I highly recommend the crab & artichoke dip.  It is on the creamy side, but the flavor is great!  The mac & cheese is exceptionally tasty too, fresh cheese, bits of ham, very creamy.\n\nThey do have a cigars available for sale too, and a pretty good wine list.  This place hasn't failed to disappoint yet, except when it ran out of their bagel chips (served as a general appetizer with salsa).	positive
There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.\n\nI was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.\n\nThe heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.\n\nThree menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.\n\nMy bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.\n\nThe roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  \n\nIt took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.	positive
This guy has lousy customer service and an arrogant poor attitude! Stated he did not have \""men\"" working in our area of Lake Norman. Asked him if he subs-out work and he said no it's only him, so his \""men working\"" statement was misleading as it's \""one man working\"". Asked him if he works Mooresville area and he said yes but he won't come on this side of the lake even though we are 20 minutes closer to his office than Mooresville. Says on his website he'll help you fix your problems over the phone but thats a false claim from this experience. AVOID AVOID AVOID Call Tarheel Appliance Service instead 980-225-7802 as they were super nice and helpful....	negative
We just spent the week at THE Hotel and were looking forward to spending time at the pool, but only spent a few hours there during our entire stay because it was over crowded and over priced even for the Strip! After fighting for two chairs in the 115 degree heat and buying an inner-tube for $23 we were then robbed by the \""Bikini Bar\"" for another $24 for a corona and a small pina colada! The lazy river was totally over crowded with screaming, splashing kids! \n\nWe will definitely be back to THE Hotel but will leave the pool for the kids!!!	negative
Finally checked this place out . Cindy was amazing. I will definitely be back for a pedi next week. Also can't wait to bring my 4yr old in to try out the kids pedi chair!!!!	positive
Dense. Weird. Fantastic. I'm not one who knows much about art, let alone the specific details about someone like Andy Warhol. That's exactly why I went. To learn and to experience. This is a really nicely laid out museum and really does a great job paying tribute to a modern great. There is a ton of pieces on display and you could spent days here. If you're in Pittsburgh, I wouldn't hesitate to visit, love him, hate him, or know nothing about him, that's why you should go.	positive
Hi my name is Leo and I'm here cuz my friend couldn't make it.\n  I visit this store about once a week, I could probably be the duke by now but I don't \""check in\"" in liquor stores, being the duke of a liquor store may not look so good on a background check. Having said that, I kind of like this store because I never had a problem finding what I'm looking for,( alcohol) except this time, I was looking for that creme de violette to make that  aviation cocktail I learned at P.J.Clarkes on saloon 101 elite event, but they had no idea what I was talking about. (They gave me that look like they were talking to a drunk.) Oh well.. Since I'm here I might as well pick up some vodka for my friends.\n   This store is huge! They carry a large selection of almost everything. You can find almost any kind of beer you're looking for. The selection of wines is very extensive making it easy to find that special wine for that special event at any budget. The collection of tequilas is also very impressive! But best of all! prices are very reasonable and they also have sales daily. When I was there they had some gin, vodka and wine tasting going on and  I tried them all,.... twice! which Made my friends  ( me, myself, and I ) very happy.\n Clientele at this store is like the clientele at any other liquor store, you'll run into the good the bad and the ugly, this is one of the few places you'll find a cop a priest a hooker and a MADD in the same line. Make sure you look at the wall of pictures of people that went for the ultimate discount, (five fingers) you might know someone there and that's where the party is at!  I'll be back for refills.  Salud Mr. Lee!	positive
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE SALMON FLAVORED CHEWING GUM...\nI've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:\n\n\""7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?\""\n\ncan you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: \""Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!\"" \n\nBut it's the locals and those that call this \""the best in Vegas\"" and \""high quality\"" that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!\n\nLook, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!\n\nThe ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.\n\nBut let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!\n\nWell, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not \""good\""), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr. \n\nThe menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.\n\nLook, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.\n\nNow, bring me a bucket!	negative
Was a Freakin Frog regular, but got tired of the stuffy attitudes.  I really missed the beer list, though, and Yardhouse doesn't come close. Most Yardhouse beer servers couldn't tell the difference from a Westvleteren and a Bud Light Wheat.  But Money Plays is unpretentious, boasts a Frog-like beer list because they poached one of the best beergeeks (a compliment) ever to pour for Mr. C., the prices are just right and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  If you live on the West side of Vegas like me, it's easier to get to.  The interior is nothing to boast about but after a couple of belgians it won't make a bit of difference.  Cheers!	positive
False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains.	negative
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it	positive
It's time for an impromptu dinner session with a close friend.  We just got through watching a friend's internet show cast at The Beat and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!\n\nWhen you get into the caf\u00e9, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!\n\nThis place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out.	positive
Service is consistently underwhelming.   The attractive AND competent servers probably work on the strip.  Food is usually good for bar fare.  Probably won't be back since there are so many other options in the area.	negative

Went to dinner on a Saturday night. The food was AH-mazing. So delish. They had a few performers during our meal. A gentleman who sang like some dude in the rat pack. And a soulful woman who sang the blues. Very cool!	positive
Tim Hortons in Montreal is kind of like the Dunkin Donuts in Boston, they are quite literally at every corner of the street. They sell quite an variety of pastries, chocolate bread, muffins, and donuts. The sizes here are usually half of what you would find in a DD, quite fresh and perfect for a snack. Both cold and hot drinks are available from latte to hot chocolate, from smoothies to ice coffee. Although equally as popular as DD in the US, it has less of a fast food type of feel to it, quite cozy and warm.	positive
Really? I had to make reservations for this place? Because on a Saturday night over Labor Day, this Envy The Steakhouse was completely dead. There was one other table in there. When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.\n\nOur waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.\n\nWell, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. \n\nWhat was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. \n\nThey had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. \n\nSo glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.	negative
This might sound brash - but for a city built on an excess to the senses, you have to execute things well.\n\nAnd the Cosmopolitan to me, is the name of my favorite drink, and is one of the newest hotels on the Strip that I kept hearing about. So I wanted to see it for myself.\n\nThe styling in the hotel fits me well. I was awed and noted a lot of the little details they infused into the place. It was like Tom Ford had a party with David Bowie and then did drugs with maybe Christian Dior or Diane von Furstenberg. Just very cool, modern, with touches of glamour everywhere.\n\nHowever, a few detrimental notes:\n\nThe Chandelier, was hyped up to me but once I was inside it - it lost its lustre. Yes, you are a sitting in a place strewn with crystals, but I expected a little more. It also didn't do them well, that once sat - it took about 10-15 minutes to be noticed. And this is while everyone is waiting in line at Marquee on a Saturday night. So needless to say, first impression of service... BLEW.\n\nThe signature Cosmopolitan sucked. And for it being the name, I expected something out of it. It's like Carrie Bradshaw took a big wee-wee in my glass. \n\nWhile styled well, the hotel might have been planned out more than what it should have been. Everything was packed in so tight and it made for a bit of claustrophobia. You couldn't see where you were going, when you walked in and about. Best design element that struck a chord were the video walls in the lobby. Those fascinated me the most.\n\nCrowd was okay - it tasted like LA walking through here. There was so many LBDs (or little black dresses to you) that it looked like Herve Leger took a big shit on the place.\n\nBottom line lies in the execution. For paying good money, you still need to be seamlessly good, and the Cosmopolitan failed at that point just on the surface. It still holds my curiosity at this point, but it wouldn't be my first choice to come back to when staying in Vegas - I don't think.	negative
A \""90 minute\"" timeshare presentation took upwards of six hours. Totally ruined our vacation. Then at the end they tried to give us different gifts than we were promised.	negative
the beerfest gets crowder and stupider the closer it gets to the weekend.\n\ni volunteer some of my time working this year at the yelp booth spreading the words to non believers about the virtue of using the website and the app itself. the shit is free to use, what's not to love? at the same time, i got to walk around and sample some beers (coupons are $1 each and beers are between 2 to 6 with the most expensive being around 12 i believe) that sounded interesting before the weekend crowd which is awesome because you get more choices.\n\nmy first stop was at dieu du ciel which you know have really great tasting beer with not much aftertaste if you're a non beer drinker, like i am. i tried the solstice d'\u00e9t\u00e9 which has a sour note because of the raspberry. it is pretty good if you enjoy fruit base alcohol and are looking for something not too off putting. there's the brise-glace which is an apple cider beer. a cider beer? i know! there's no words to describe it besides, fucking good!\n\nmy second stop was at trou du diable. a beerfest without stopping by them is plain stupid! any beer they offer is pretty good. i couldn't remember the name of it but it's definitely not the succubus as that one sold out pretty quick.\n\nthird stop at beau's all natural brew. definitely the highlight of the fest for me. i tried the bog water which is ok but the hogan's goat and especially the russian imp (a black beer) will make a beer lover out of you!\n\nfor my fourth stop, i made my way across the hall to the lovely peluso stand to sample the smoked barley wine from pit caribou that another yelper working the booth suggest me to try. if you are looking for something totally different to try, this one it is. there's that light charcoal taste you get at first and it smooths out once swallow. you'll enjoy it if you love bbq.\n\nmy fifth stop was at the brazilian stand where i tried some banana beer. it smelled like banana, doesn't taste like banana but there's a light sweetness to it that makes it enjoyable provide that you enjoy sweet beer.\n\nsixth and final stop was at the international stand to try some nogne brand beer. it's a norwegian beer brand and by that time, i was pretty out of it so i can't really remember anything besides drinking it all.\n\nUPDATE: on my last day working the yelp booth, me and some yelper sample some more stands. At first, we were looking for a second round of la brise-glace from dieu but they were sold out. kinda a bit bum, I walked over to our neighbour booth friend and asked if they knew about any other cider vendor which led us to la branche. The ice cider wasn't bad while the maple cider and the bubbly cider were hits amongst us. Before that, I walked over to the maple stand for some maple cider tasting. While I don't remember the name, there's one cider that had a maple butter like taste. It was rich, creamy and so ever smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Too bad you had to shell out money for a bottle instead of getting a 4 ouncer like most booths. And I went back to peluso for a second go at that smoked barley. I don't know if it was because of the maple cider I taste just before but I detected some lychee note amongst other things in the beer which I didn't previously. interesting\n\nfor food, i stopped by the globe trotteur stand to get some seal merguez and skippy burger (kangaroo). it is a bit pricey for what you're getting (the skippy is a slider) even though it's pretty tasty. if i could keep on affording it, i'd keep eating skippy ;)\n\nbad monkey popcorn is some freaking good popcorn! the ketchup one is not bad, a bit sweet like you'd expect from ketchup powder stuff. the jalapeno is quite spicy! me and some yelper choked on some kernels. the nachos and all dressed ones were the best of the bunch. considering it's 2 for $5, you can't go wrong with both. i did hear that they have some caramel and jalapeno popcorn which sounded interesting.\n\nUPDATE: while I was enjoying some wine I sneak in from home (had to drink something else too), I felt it was missing some cheese so I head over to fromage d'ici and got a trio of Roy Leo (I think) cheese plate. It was some good cheese but the mouthwatering one was the cheese fondue platter of the 3 cheeses that I got too. Made with some white wine, we just couldn't help ourselves. Words don't do justice of how good it was. You have to put it in your mouth to really grasp the collective mouthgasm we had!\n\nwe did get some freebies from our neighbour beer booth but that is between booth neighbours.\n\nmost staff working are pretty nice and friendly. we even got them to join in our photo madness!\n\nif you love beer or want to try something better than the non drinkable commercial stuff you get at grocery stores, you ought to attend the fest and sample. the best times are wednesday and early thursday where you can stroll around and hear yourself talk. i didn't really like beer but after trying multiple ones, i can definitely say it's almost love at first beer	positive
Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes.	positive
Back in August, in the peak of summer heat, a local showed me this place because he knows Im a vegetarian (a hard thing to be in Vegas!). I was very suspicious of his recommendation because most Thai places are not strictly vegetarian and can get pretty slippery when it comes to the fish oil. I was very pleasantly surprised by the integrity of their veggie options... they didnt smell fishy in the least.\n\nIn fact, their intentions were so clean that when I asked for \""hot\"" on the \""low/medium/hot\"" scale, the waitress refused! I said, \""come on, i want it hot, baby!\"" said: \""you cant handle \""the hot\"", im sorry darling\""... and the more she denied me her spicy goodness, the more I wanted it. finally she gave it up when I said, \""lacking any chest hair, i've disgraced my indian ancestors, now gimme those chilies to get my testosterone flowin' sweetheart!\"" she winked at me, and sent in the order.\n\nand lemme tell ya, the \""hot\"" was frickin' amazing... made us sweat bullets, and nothing beats the Vegas summer than a blazing hot bowl of green curry. unfortunately my friend (the local), completely forgetting how tortuously hot the curry was,  gave the left overs to a homeless guy sitting on the street under the 110 degree heat. poor dude didnt even have a bottle of water handy either!	positive
Ohh don't get me started on Cox.  First when you have ANY problem at all, getting a live human being on the phone takes up to 15 minutes as you weave your way through \""press one for... ok now press ..\"".  Then the most they can do if your cable isn't working is tell you to unplug the box  and plug it back in.  Technical genius!  Then they schedule you a cocky, know-it-all but still somehow totally unhelpful technician to come out like four or eight days later.  We've been through seven boxes since we moved  six months ago because the dvr freezes and doesn't record properly ... on a regular basis.  I just think for the RIDICULOUS amount they charge me, the fact that we MUST have cable just to get any kind of regular programming, and the amount of problems their service has on a regular basis ... it should be a HELL OF A LOT EASIER TO GET ISSUES RESOLVED OR EVEN JUST TO TALK TO A LIVE PERSON.	negative
My experience was alright. The food was average. I was expecting amazing from all the buss about this place. Our waiter was sub-par and not very attentive to us, or nice for that matter and there was this really loud and obnoxious blonde waitress's that kept yelling and singing very badly to the music. She didn't even know the words. Very annoying. Just cause it wasn't that busy doesn't mean there aren't customers here. It was so annoying to eat with this waitress walking around being so irritating.	negative
