good store	negative
Was is good.. Yes\nDid it blow me away.. No\n\nI arrived here about 4:45pm Monday evening. It was me and the photographer for AZ Republic. \n\nI look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal. \n\nI opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each. \n\nWhat I liked: \n-Chips with out having to order them separate.  \n-Tacos full of meat. \n-Staff was nice\n-Rice and Beans were good. \n-The salsa bar...way cool\n\nMeh:  \n-Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side)\n-meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose. \n\n\nIt seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4	positive
Pretty outstanding museum, I'm only going to add one little tip!\n\nStay the hell away from the cafe, they serve the weakest coffee in the world and it's mighty expensive. It's practically just water. Get your own from Starbucks down the street (i'm sure they'll open a new one closer next week).\n\nDon't let this put you off from what is this country's best tourist attraction.	positive
We had dimsum for dinner on a Saturday night at Orchids Garden. They serve dimsum all day from 10:30am - 10:30pm. Since they don't take reservations, we decided to go at 5:30pm - early enough before it gets too crowded.\n\nWaitresses walk around with carts filled with plates of dimsum, and they stop at each table. You pay per plate by category. As you take plates, the watresses stamp your food bill:\nA ($2.30) - our favorites are the Steamed BBQ Bun and for dessert: Baked Sweet Cream Bun and Red Bean Sesame Ball.\nB ($3.10) - our favorites are Shrimp Hargow, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Shrimp Pasted Eggplant (make sure you get the sauce), Pan Fried Chives Dumpling, Shrimp with Rice Noodle, and for dessert: Mango or Coconut Pudding (with sweetened condensed milk.)\nC ($4.15) - Sugar Cane Shrimp\nD ($6.15) - Chinese Broccoli, Seaweed Salad, and the Chow Mein.\n\nThe standouts are the Chow Mein (even though $6.15 is over-priced for noodles), the Steamed BBQ Bun is the best deal, Pan Fried Chives Dumplings were our favorite, and the best dessert is the Baked Sweet Cream Bun!  Although we love the Seaweed Salad, the portion size is so small, it's not worth $6.15.\n\nSeven of us ate everything we wanted for a total of $82 plus tax. That's a pretty good deal! This is our favorite dimsum place in Vegas!	positive
now i've discovered why i've never given this place a bother.\n\nas previous reviews have attested-- service is non-existent; instead, its the peripheral glance of the same servers rushing past your table as if they were real fucking busy. really? we've been waiting for half an hour or so already. deciding that my ass had become numb from waiting, we managed to flag down a hastily walking server and finally gave our order. \n\nso, pomegranate margarita is OK. seafood kibis is frozen product, thawed, fried, not very seafood. lamb kibis is the less appetizing $12.95 unfolded version of much tastier gyro that can be found elsewhere for half the price. i suppose its good we were saved the task of having to answer to \""how's everything tasting?\""...because, quite precisely, everything is not tasting [good] at all. \n\nfez is one of those places that you go to, wait a long time (in hopes that the food redeems itself), and receive a server who places more importance on their strut and getting your friends number. ultimately you are left with underwhelming food, money and time, wasted.	negative
Small German bread shop that carries breads, pastries, and other German foods.\n\nThe store front was clean and organized and all the pastries appeared fresh. The woman working gave us a few extra donuts knowing it was our first time. \n\nI ordered:\n\nPretzel roll- chewy on the outside and doughy on the inside\n\nBerliner- not overly sweet like most jelly donuts found in American donut shops. Strawberry jelly is made in house but their is only a small dollop towards the end of the donut \n\n3 seed bread- all breads are made without sugar and personally I like my bread to be a bit sweet. Bread is chewy, soft in the middle and you can taste how few ingredients are used \n\nPrices are more than reasonable, customer service is great , and you can taste the freshness in each and every item.	positive
I didn't like it. Yes it was cheap but the massage style was too rough for me. I prefer the Swedish from massage envy. Save your money and treat yourself right.	negative
During the summertime I live on bingsoo. In fact, during the wintertime I live on bingsoo as well. Because it's that damn good. Everyone here is super friendly too. That may be because I come in 3 times a week though. You can even get a little frequent buyers punch card and after your 10th bingsoo or whatever you get you get a free one. Awwwee yeeahh. I've heard that the bingsoo they serve here isn't \""authentic\"", but who cares - it's to die for.	positive
after finally checking in at 6p, though we got to and started drinking at Vegas at 6a, we had some mean munchies. because we dropped a pretty penny at the tables already and desperate to consume our body weight in food, we flipped through those Vegas mags to find a great deal.\n\nenter Lucky 7s. $7.77... are you f-ing $hitting me!!!! the roar of my buddies as i mentioned this blessed bargain was greater than the roar of our empty, yet liquid filled bellies. contemplated taking the car back out of the valet and driving or cabbing. as you would imagine, the type of person that gets excited for $7.77 buffets does not do taxis. we chipped in for the $2 valet tip and headed down.\n\nthis place is in the Plaza in DT Vegas. not the most scenic of drives, and especially long when hungry. dropped the car at the valet where Mr Burns got my keys and positioned his frail body into my F150. \n\ngot in, paid and sat. it was more glorious than i would've imagined! they had 2 sections, american and chinese! $7.77 for a trip to heaven? i'll take two!!! the chinese side was typical Hong Kong express food. heavily breaded orange chicken and salty chow mein. the american side had fried chicken, mac n cheese, shepherd's pie, pot roast, etc. they had a carving station where the meat looked like it had to be dipped in gravy (overnight) to get back some moisture. oh, and the salad section could've used some gravy as well. \n\nneedless to say from that description, we gorged ourselves like death row inmates at midnite. i typically do 3 rounds plus desert. make it 4 for this trip. i had to. it's $7.77!!! \n\nmy only complaint about the place? it's far. otherwise, its awesome! c'mon, do you really expect a place charging $7.77 to get a bad review from me? IT'S $7.77 FOR A BUFFET! i got exactly what i paid for. YUMMY!	positive
Steak \""special\"" was 80% fat and lacked flavor, mussels undercooked, pasta overcooked, garlic mashed potatoes that set your mouth on fire, subpar service... Save your money	negative
No matter what featured flavor they are you must try the mussels... House of the rising sun drink is fantastic! Service is always very friendly and professional .. Small but comfortable environment! Encourage you to make reservations.	positive
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative
My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese/Asian restaurant. \nWe were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night. \nAfter we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that.\nMy husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis. \nHis beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible. \nThe two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful. \nThe one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea. Other than that, I would never recommend anyone I know to this place to waste their money. There's a lot of other better Japanese restaurants in town.	negative
Beer selection was just ok. Chicken drum app was good.  Shrimp cocktail looked like it came from a frozen ring you get at the supermarket. When the fried chicken and waffle salad came out undercooked I was so excited that I could send that awful thing back without having to say I was disappointed and the ranch dressing was sour. I wanted to try something new but it was not good. The few pieces of waffles were hard and small like cereal. They offered dessert since I did not want to try anything else. Dessert was ok. They serve mini milkshakes with each one they were good. The pecan dessert was the best. The chocolate cake tasted like old cold store bought cake. They also gave a key lime ripe of cake that they should be embarrassed to serve. I love that type if dessert but it was bad!   Don't waste your time here there are plenty if excellent restaurants on Vegas. I love to find out and this was not cheap and not very good. I was do excited to try a Michael Mina restaurant and now I don't want to try another one. Ill end on a positive note by saying the staff was very friendly and accommodating.	negative
Not impressed with the quality of ice cream, long waits abb\u00e9 customer service.  I will not be returning.	negative
It was purely by accident that my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant.  He had an Enjoy book coupon for D'Amico's that he wanted to use and I, having dined at D'Amicos (it wasnt good), had been dragging my heels about going back to D'Amicos.  We were really surprised when we arrived at found that D'Amico's was now Vino's/Ilario's Trattoria but we decided since we were there--why not try it out.\n\nWe walked in through the Vino's Bar door--the dining room is on the left side and there is a bar on the right hand side.  D'Amico's bar has a group of gnarled old men who have been regulars sitting on the same bar stools for the past 25 years and they dont want you there.  As soon as you open the door, all the conversation in the bar stops an they turn and look at you.  And they are NOT welcoming. \n\nThey really need a sign indicating which door is for the dining room.  Had I not previously dined at DAmicos and didn't know the dining room was on the left I probably would have walked right out of the bar.  I hope their management sees this; maybe they could do something about this.  The bar is actually really cute inside but ...Id be scared to drink there.\n\nAnyway--lets talk about Ilario's Trattoria/Vino's\n\nThis is not a 4 star restaurant but they get 4 stars from me because I loved the food and the atmosphere and the prices were great.\n\nThe dining room has had a complete overhall and it's cozy and romantic with exposed brick and murals.  We were seated right away.  Given the look of the dining room I was afraid dinner was going to be very expensive but everything on the menu seems to be $15,95 and comes with a salad and a side.\n\nI had the scallops which were pan seared just right and served in a lemon garlic sauce.  It was pretty damn good.  My friend had the seafood linguini with red sauce.  It was packed with seafood and excellent.  I highly recommend both dishes, and the mussels.  We had beer with our dinner and i was surprised it was only $3 a beer.\n\nPrior to our entrees they brought out crusty bread and olive oil which was fantastic and a little doughy, which is exactly how I like it.\n\nI highly recommend you try this restaurant out, and strongly urge you--use the door on the left side!	positive
This location doesn't honor internet coupons. They are very \""No can do\"" oriented..They don't budget on anything. They always make a mistake. They have no idea what customer service even is. Bad management!	negative
This place is super funny.. one hell of a joke. I placed an order at 4am... started getting anxious and curious by 5:30am. Called them and asked when the driver would be here. She said \""the driver isnt picking up his phone. I dont know where he is\"" she hung up on me. I called back.. the same lady answered. She then said i dont know Whats going on but the delivery hours are closed now. Pizza guy shows up at 6am. I open the pizza and the whole order was wrong & the pizza was cold.. ive never been so flabbergasted in my life.	negative
I went to Porte Greque tonight for my first time tonight (Monday Night) and I was very dissatisfied. I went because I had a coupon--2 meals, each with soup and dessert for 20$--that I received for supporting a local sports team.\nThe soup of the day was white bean soup. It was okay but nothing special. I ordered the Shish Kabab; marinated pork tenderloin skewered with onions and green peppers. I have to admit that the pork was very good and moist, but the kabab had only 2 tiny pieces of pepper and 3 tiny onion pieces.\nThe salad was an obvious cheap-out. A huge bed of iceberg lettuce with a quarter of a tomato, a few cucumbers, and barely any dressing. (Was it a store-bought dressing? I don't know... I could barely taste it over the blandness of the iceberg.) \nThe rice was the standard yellow rice that is served at so many other Greek restaurants. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside but bland on the inside.\nThere were no choices for dessert other than chocolate cake. It was okay, but I am not a huge fan and would have liked something other than chocolate cake. \nThe service was okay; our waitress was friendly and helpful. Parking was not an issue because it is a private lot.	negative
the jerk went out of buisness and kept our money!  thanks alot travelzoo for letting a cheap vendor be on there!!!!	negative
I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service. \n\nThe location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile.	negative
Ok so we finally got a chance to check Tao a club everyone raves about, and yeah it sorta lives up to its rep. We went 2 saturdays ago and the place was PACKED no Im telling u....PACKED!\nSo we roll up and it looked like an hour long wait but we got in right away, no guest list, no lines or anything due to the fact that the girls we were with just had to do was be flirty w/the bouncers and BAM we were in!!!\nSo we get in and this is how it goes:\nPROS:\n1) Decent DJ\n2) Drinks are good\n3) Go Go dancers are HOT!\n4) Lotta eye candy\n5) Club is nice really done up & big\n\nCons:\n1) if ur ugly or have no pull expect to wait for like an hour\n2) the main dance floor is INSANELY packed, I mean like scary u might get trampled PACKED.\n3) Drinks are pricey, but hey its vegas what do u expect.\n\nSo over all yeah the place is good times but I still prefer the Hollywood scene theres no place like home, yall should check it, hope this helps.	positive
Disgusting food dirty food nasty people habib the owner is very cheap and charge extra for the food don't come here you get treated like crap wait 2 hours for nothing and get overcharged DO NOT COME HERE FAKE PERSIAN CUSINE THIS PLACE IS AN EMBARESSMENT	negative
This is one of the most horrendous establishments in Charlotte, NC! The staff is very unprofessional. They also smoke outside, at the front door where customers walk in, and I am not talking about one or two at a time,  but all at one time! The prices are ridiculous! They charge like they are Starbucks for coffee beverages. Please... This establishment disgusts me! They haven't kept the same staff longer than a couple of months. Which to me means that there is poor management. If you have the option to go to another DD's run there!  Stay away from this place!	negative
Worst Hotel ever to exist.  I know that the hotel around are a little more expensive.  But I would pay more not to have to deal with the front desk.  Most rude. Employees ever. \nAlso the rooms are worth about 20$ a night and my reasons would be the fact that my car got broke into 2 nights in a row.  I left the doors unlocked and they still broke the windows.\nWhen I informed the front desk the red head manager who refused to give me her name.\nSaid exact words \"" you park a brand new truck here what did you expect to happed\""\nI said what.  Next response was classic.\nHer words . \"" Well why did u stay here again if it happened last night.ans the camera are jut for us to watch most don't work . And told lvpd..they would have to get a Written order from the court before the would release the tapes.	negative
Totally unadulterated indulgence.\n\nBeautiful pastries, chocolates and that world record chocolate fountain! A must visit for any sweet tooth.\n\nI had the best Ham and Cheese Croissant here! \n\nIf you love Nutella, the Nutella Brioche could be your thing, thought it was a bit much for me.\n\nJust the smell of the store, butter and chocolate is enough to get you mesmerized.\n\nFor photos and full reviews please visit my blog.	positive
The Good:\n-Smoke-free, clean, classy hotel\n-1 bedroom suites are very spacious, huge bathroom with a jacuzzi and two sinks\n-Can usually get an upgrade for $50 from a normal room to a suite at check-in\n-8 minute walk to the wynn / 5 minutes to the mall\n-Slightly cheaper than the other hotels on the strip\n-Concierge was helpful\n-There was a shuttle to Caesars but it was slow to arrive; it did run late which was nice\n\nThe Bad:\n-You pay a resort fee despite the fact that there are few amenities compared to the other resorts\n-Pool is small and not enough umbrellas, we were baking in the sun; it also took 45 minutes for us to get our drinks and food was eh\n-King bed in bedroom was great but the pull out couch had an extremely uncomfortable mattress and a maximum of 2 people can fit on it\n-There is no nightlife, great restaurants or pool party	positive
Sarah and Francis are an awesome team!  They gave me same day service, were on time, friendly, honest, and took there time.  There was no up-selling, pricing was great, but most importantly the job was high quality! You simply can't ask for more.  Thanks again!!!	positive
I took my husband to see this show for an early Birthday celebration because according to him all of his Birthdays have \""sucked\"". I would have to agree with him so I wanted to plan something he would truly enjoy. Musicals aren't really his thing even though I do drag him along sometimes so I figured I'd choose something more him. I chose the Fantasy show because he enjoys looking at \""naked ladies\"". I dunno I guess it's a guy thing! \n\nThe show is much more then women dancing around naked. The host Lorena Peril can really belt out a tune. She has a strong voice like Christina Aguilera. She likes to get the audience involved so you never know what will happen. Lorena also seems pretty nice. After the show during the meet and greet I was trying to sneak a picture of her signing my husband's calendar because I was too shy to ask her to pose with him. When she noticed me trying to take a picture she said, \""You want me to pose with him? ..cause I'll pose with him.\"" I thought that was pretty cool and the picture turned out really good! \n\nIf you don't want to have attention showered on you throughout the show don't sit in the front row. We were in the second row but the guy in front of us was the center of jokes, had to dance like a Chippendale dancer and he got to go up on the stage with the girls to be a part of their performance. It was all in good fun though him and his wife were good sports about it! \n\nThen someone unexpected comes on the stage ...a guy ...he wasn't on the poster! His name was Sean Cooper and he was hilarious! He first came out doing impressions of James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr. but his jokes are the best! He also did the rap during Lorena's \""Hips Don't Lie\"" number. We were lucky enough to catch him after the meet and greet to get pictures and tell him how funny we thought he was. He was also really cool about it. \n\n The show was pretty good even to the harshest of critics. I know because I was sitting next to one. This old guy was sitting near me with a stern look on his face for practically the whole show ( I'm a people watcher..so I always looked at him for his reaction during every number...I'm nosy like that.) but he even cracked a small smile. It was during the Michael Jackson impersonation though...go figure!	positive
went there for a friend's birthday party. the food is really good. loukoumades, lamb, octopus, eggplants, can't go wrong with those. didn't like the cheese dish as it was too salty\n\nit is expensive though. came out to $75 per head but we did eat quite well	positive
We came here for the shave ice & found out they have so much more. They sell all kinds of snacks, desserts, pupus, and even boba. I only got the chance to try the shave ice (with ice cream and azuki beans), pork hash, and poi mochi. They even have a kids table w/ toys & a tv w/ cartoons playing. I will definitely be back to try their cakes, malasadas, guri-guri, coco puffs, and boba.	positive
The gentlemen at discount tire were polite and respectful. They were going to repair my damaged tire for free and when they should have been going home on Christmas eve.. I really needed new tires but they were never pushy. When I tried to make an appointment for after Christmas they instead took care of my car at that time--probably an hour after close. \nWhat a Christmas gift. I am new to las Vegas and am glad I found this store	positive
