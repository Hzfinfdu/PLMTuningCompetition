This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.\n\nHowever, the boba's texture was definitely on point.	negative
High ticket prices, seats don't recline, tiny theater and dirty bathrooms. \n\nThat sums this place up. If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.	negative
I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.\n\nBUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!\n\nWe arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen. \n\nThe chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite. \n\nAfter looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)\n\nAt this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time. \n\nYou're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.	positive
Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.  \n\nFor $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.	negative
I definitely am a big fan of the panda express chain, and just so happens 2 be closest 2 my house. :-)	positive
We had breakfast there before driving back to LA. The food was really good. My husband had pancakes and I had a Mile High omelet. Yum!	positive
My friends and I went here because we were already in Bally's and didn't want to walk around searching for a sushi place to satisfy our craving. Walked up to the joint and you can tell it's small. There was a menu in the front and my husband pointed out the sushi boat and because we always want to eat a sushi boat at every restaurant we go to, we decided to go here. My friends never tried a sushi boat so they got one too. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in the sushi love boat. It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT. Go elsewhere if you're in the mood for sushi. The only good thing here is the service. The waitress was very friendly to my friend. She was treated like she was the daughter or relative.	negative
One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Literally. We were just looking for a nice meal close to our convention center hotel and made a very poor choice. \nOnce seated, we waited more than 10 minutes for water and then had to ask for the drink menu. After finally ordering, the drinks/food did come quickly. I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it. And once the check was finally corrected, the manager than hovered next to until signed (with her hand on the back of one of the chairs at our table!)! \nAdd to this the awful faux fireworks and drummer guy who spent half his time on the phone, and it was a very poor experience.	negative
We got this hotel as a quick overnight. We didn't stay long term and we didn't care about the casino\n\nThe elevators and halls smelled of smoke.  Our rooms did not.\n\nWe ordered two rooms ahead of time specifically to have the rooms side by side and two queens in each.  In fact, were charged an extra $10 per room for this.  When we arrived at the room, there was one bed in each room.  Back to the front desk, they found two rooms right away each with two beds, about 10 rooms apart from each other.  Extra star for the good customer service.  Remove one star for not honoring our request in the first place and not paying attention to the details of our reservation.\n\nThe room overall was fine, the tub was not clean as I would prefer.  Otherwise seemed ok.  \n\nWe didn't come to Vegas for the casinos, to gamble or anything else like that. It was a 36-hour trip and the one overnight in this place fit the bill.\n\nIf I were staying any length of time, this would not be the place.	negative
Great wings. Was in Madison a couple of days ago and I needed a quick bite. Loved the wings. Get boneless, Cajun BBQ, you won't regret it.	positive
Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it? \n\nThe staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there. \n\nI admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down: \n\nHits: \nThe Tabbouleh salad was tasty. \nThe rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful. \nChicken kabob was spot on. \nThe garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places. \nTasty iced tea. (garden variety) \n\nMisses: \nBaba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good. \nHummus could use more spice. \nFalafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle. \nSpinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish. \nChicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it....\nPitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better? \n\nAnd completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves. \n\nFinal verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good.	negative
I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try. Variety was lacking and the old fashioned donut I tried tasted like it was left out overnight. Not fresh whatsoever. Two star experience for sure !	negative
If you know what Scotch you like, chances are they have it.\n\nI am just learning the nuances of drinking scotch. I heard good things about Magnums and I have been twice. \nBoth times I left a little overwhelmed...but I have now had time to evaluate my experiences and put some thought into it.\nI was in a real bad mood the second visit, but I my evaluation still holds when I think back.\n\nFirst visit - Ordered two (2) flights (samples of scotches, had four (4) in each flight - Magnums choice). Scotch was served in the traditional vinum and there was an adequate amount to properly \""sample\"". Their \""machine\"" was broken and we were each given a total price (seemed a little pricey...but  hey, it is Scotch.) I noticed the smell of AZ tap water in the glasses, but being a newbie, I was not sure what was proper etiquette. That was then...\n\nSecond visit - I was in a really bad mood and probably should have stayed home, but I did not. I was schooled the week before by a scotch lover with an extensive selection of fine scotches in his cabinet. I also researched the proper scotch tasting techniques. Armed with this knowledge and a little practice earlier in the week, I ordered one flight of four (4)  - my selections.\nI kindly asked if they could hand wash the glasses (because of visit #1). I was told they wash their glasses in filtered water and some other stuff, I don't remember. (I was fending off my friends jokes about how they were going to spit clean my glasses because I was being too picky), so I smiled and said OK.\n\nWhatever the case, they did not smell like AZ tap water. The glasses were rocks\\old fashion glasses. Picky? Absolutely.  If I am paying good money at a fancy scotch bar...and sampling multiple scotches...put them in the proper glass so I can have a proper sample!!! To top it all off, there was barely one swallow per glass. FAR less than what was gotten the first time. Not even a half a standard swig!  I ordered my favorite of the four afterwards and I would have to say the samples were about 1/5 of what a full order is...but charged for 1/2 of the drink.\nAm I wrong in my perception? Maybe, but I'd like someone to explain their flight pricing to me .\n\nThe place it too small to reserve tables. The first night they had three tables reserved and no-one showed up! I saw potential customers walk in and turn around and leave because there was no place to sit...and there were those three (3) empty tables with \""Reserved\"" signs on them. The second visit, there was one reserved table. We ordered, paid and left...and that one table was still empty. REALLY??? Wonder how much money they lost on the no shows.\nAs a side note, my friend wanted a specific scotch. He had me call earlier in the day to see if they had it. I was told they did not. Fair enough...Then we got there and my friend asked in the front where the liquor store and humidor are...still out (and for the last couple of weeks). he also ordered it and when she went back to check if they have it they did. mmmmm... This confused me..did they have a secret stash for regular customers and succumbed to his persistence and break it out for him, or give him something else and say it was what he wanted just to shut him up? Tooo fishy. \n\nI am disappointed!! Magnums is so close to home and I could see myself spending more time and money there. The interior is VERY comfortable. The bar is amazing. The tables (when you can get them are just like I want at home. Chairs are comfortable. They have multiple TVs hanging the walls with various sports on them (muted audio). But even better,  they have the center screens above the bar playing concert videos WITH the concert audio. It is obvious the owners paid a lot of attention to detail in every aspect. I SOOOOO WANTED Magnums to be that place. I am sad that is was not.	negative
We started off waiting for 20 minutes. And plus the hostess skipped us. We got inside and the restaurant layout is too crowded and too small. Third they got my drink wrong. The food was good. Nothing too special. Its better to enjoy if ordered takeout tho. Fourth the waiter did not even check on us. We had to get his attention for a refill. Overall not a good experience.	negative
I really do love going to Starbucks and this one is RIGHT by my house.  YEAH!  It's usually busy, but the line goes fast.  The ONLY complaint I've had about this one are the vagrants that hang around from time to time.  They aren't always there, but when they are, it stands out in your head.	positive
Came here after a long night at Tao. This place is 24/7 so you'll see tons of people here for some late night munchies. I got the #13 which was the combo Pho. It was delicious. The broth was amazing and the meats were so good. Noodles were perfect... not too chewy nor soft. Good way to end a night.	positive
Went back again this year and still great!	positive
If you're looking to build a computer and don't want to wait for an order from Newegg, then this place is probably perfect for you.\n\nEvery time I walk in here, I am always overwhelmed by how HUGE this place is.  There's a cafe in the middle.  A CAFE.  Where there are beverages and food.  So if you get too tired from walking or just plain lost, go right on to the middle and find this little oasis to recharge.\n\nPrices aren't too bad, but you can almost always get it cheaper online.  The sections are well-organized and I usually do not have any problems finding anything.  I've also built my own computer and work for a tech-related startup, so I know what a lot of the signs are pointing to.\n\nThe line can be super annoying!  They usually get people through pretty fast at least.\n\nAnother downer is sometimes the sales associates can be aggressive as it seems that they get a percentage of the sale.\n\nI recently went to pick up some items for my boss and an associate sort of scooped me up so I could find them faster than I already did (saved me ~10 seconds).  Then she asked if she could tally my basket under her name so she gets credit or something to that effect.\n\nMy trade-off?  \""Sure, if I can get to the front of the line.\""  That worked pretty well that day, but I can't promise it'll work for you.\n\nFun to browse as long as you don't get heckled by the workers.  \""No, I don't need help, thank you\"" and stern eye contact works most of the time for me.	positive
I automatically love a place where the owner playfully gives me grief for \""walkin into a beef place and orderin a grilled cheese\"". Cuz thats what I did.\n\nYes, Mama's has an italian beef/ vienna beef dog heavy menu, but they also have salads, and sandwiches not including italian beef (just in case youre not in the mood for it like I was).\n\nThe two guys behind the counter were very nice. They struck up conversations w/ all the customers (its nice when people actually try and get to know their clientele), and gave some of us grief.\n\nTheir prices are decent especially for the amount of food you get. My grilled cheese however was meh. It wasnt the melty deliciousness I was craving, though I have a little to do w/ that though since I chose 2 cheeses. Next time, one cheese will equal melty perfection, Im sure of it.\n\nParking for this place is minimal. Youll be lucky to find a place on the street in front or a space in the small lot in back (uncovered). Id beware of parking in the Tempe feed lot as all their spaces have signs specifically for their customers.\n\nAll in all, Mamas is a nice little lunch spot.	positive
For the night club only... It was way the hell too crowded due to the space being very small.	negative
Ceviche Classico, Limo Saltado, Tilia Malbec--Inca heaven in Madison.  All I was missing was Machu Picchu in the background.  Speaking of background....the music was Zamfir on the Pan Flute piping away covers to the kind of depressing, silly and sentimental tunes you typically only hear at Japanese restaurants in California.  (\""I am a Woman in Love\"" by Barbara Striesand, \""Hello\"" by Lionel Ritchie, etc.)  And they have a squeaky door to the kitchen that sounds like a crying elephant, which adds truly emotional, life-and-death mammilian notes to the restaurant score.  Gypsy Kings or some Archive and some oil on that door would completely liven up the mood, though. \n\nOverall, it was great (and my server was awesome, bringing out spicy, then spicier salsas so I could get my endorphin rush on).	positive
DO NOT STAY HERE. The cleaning ladies robbed us. They took all of our cash, and jewelry this weekend. All the hotel manager did is give us a $100 credit that was used up with lunch and one drink. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas, and I was giving Ceasars a chance since I had never been. I should have just gone with the Wynn or Cosmo where I normally stay. Extremely disappointed.	negative
When this place first opened, I used to drive all the way from Green Valley just to come here - I was addicted to the amazing haupia cake (freshly baked at the bakery next door). The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway... \n\nI've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch. \n\nThe owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake. \n\nThey're also open a little later and  7 days a week now. Not sure if they still close for about a month around xmas/new years though.	positive
I rent a house and my tenants notified me the fridge I provided was no longer keeping cool. Not knowing what to do, I googled \""fridge repair\"" and found Appliance Works. I must say I'm very impressed! \n\nThey had same day inspection, were courteous and professional, and waited for my approval before doing anything. Their prices were also reasonable with multiple options for me in how far I wanted to go repairing.\n\nRecommended!	positive
I recently concluded a visit to Las Vegas. Initially, we were to be staying in this hotel. Quite frankly, I'm glad we didn't. The hotel looks old and dirty. The only part of the hotel that I found tolerable to look at was the lobby. This comes at no surprise since in order to check the hotel, one must enter the lobby and that's your first impression of the ENTIRE building. Nice way to trick people. \n\nTrying to kill some time around the area, we decided to play some games in the arcade. If you're wheelchair bound, it'll be very easy to get lost and you'll probably feel it's impossible to enjoy the \""fun\"" located above the casino. I would consider mapping out your trip of the place before you enter to prevent further frustration.\n\nAfter having a little bit of fun in the arcade we had to find out where to redeem our tickets earned. There are two areas. One area is only opened up on the weekends. There is no sign indicating this, so you'll probably stand there for a few moments wondering why employees are passing by you without helping you. Only AFTER we stood around for a few minutes and asked, the employee informed us of another prize station on the other side.\n\nThe wait there was just as irritating. We waited for about five or ten minutes. I was debating whether or not I should simply hop over and collect the proper prizes myself and leave the tickets on the table. Finally, someone showed up. No apology for the long wait, not even a \""hello\"" or a general acknowledgment of our presence.  More of a look of \""What do you want\""?\n\nI suppose the upside to the  trip was the employee let us slide with our prizes being 5 tickets short.  But that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact.\n\nTo the employees: Smile. Guests like me are the reason why you're even employed. Be happy about that.	negative
I guess you get what you pay for.  I just needed a place to crash and wanted it to be cheap, and that's what I got.  My \""non-smoking\"" room smelled like a two-pack a day shut in had lived there, there was trash under the bed (nothing scandalous, an empty water bottle and a potato chip bag), the safe had been closed by another guest and the ice machine didn't work.  None of these things is huge for me, but things add up.\n\nThe check in experience was a zoo, with people everywhere, long lines and a strange amount of time to check in once I got to the front of the line.  The front desk clerk was very nice and seemed professional, but spent endless minutes inexplicably hitting the enter key, the arrow key, or clicking on something.  i thought I might unknowingly be in a comedy skit of some kind.\n\nI can't comment on the gaming experience or any other the other things Circus Circus has to offer, but after a 10 year absence from Las Vegas, this experience does not make me inclined to return, and if I do it will be to another hotel.\n\nThe only positive aspect of my stay was a very low price and a resort fee that is lower and therefore a little less stupid than most other properties in Las Vegas.	negative
I came a few months back and was completely unimpressed by the whole experience. We were hungry and needed lunch. The food was not particularly memorable, service less so. We didn't order drinks, although I hear they have plenty of options.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that it's a decent location to watch a game and have a drink. For me, however, the sheer number of TVs was overwhelming and my entire meal felt pretty schizophrenic. \n\nIt will do in a pinch, but not my first or sixth choice, for that matter. There are much better options at the Met.	negative
Great little market that manages to carry most everything.  Makes me sorry Madison doesn't more neighborhood markets.  Surprisingly good selection of produce, ice cream, wine and beer.  Many of the cashiers seem disengaged which is too bad since so many of the customers are from the neighborhood and would probably like to make eye contact with the cashiers they see regularly.\n\nBring cash - credit cards aren't accepted.	positive
Ive been here a couple times while shopping.. Good for draft beers happy hour and the mexico ish rocky point feel,.. cigarette smoke, stinky fish and stale beer smell. Its great until you order the food. Service was fast and friendly.  Knowledgeable and talkative with the hungover customers at the end of the bar getting their hair of the dog..   So I thought  I'd try the fish tacos grilled ( mahi mahi on the menu) . I remember eating here before a couple years ago and thinking it sucked. Nothings changed. The fish tacos tasted really fishy. Like reaaallly fishy. So fishy I couldnt finish the bite and lost my appetite. The black beans were dried up around the edges like they'd been sitting under a hot lamp and the rice was boxed... my grama is white and makes wayyy better... but either way the mahi mahi was so fishy i was concerned for the health and safety of future patrons.  Like Really fishy!  I sent the dish back and stuck with the beer.  The waitress was cool and offered the menu, stated she \""would tell the cooks to check the fish\""..,  but I still left hungry. Might come back for happy hour drafts. :(	negative
Well, I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore, that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25, I still gotta have 'em, they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better, and I like it more than the green sauce now.\n\nIf I could knock 'em on anything, I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos, but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce, and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes, I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve.	positive
If you order sushi, ask for the secret menu.  The regular menu has regular rolls (standard stuff like Spicy Tuna and things of that sort).  We usually go for sushi, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the appetizers and the bowls.  The wings are very good (boneless, skinless tenders in sauce).  \n\nThe best part is the beer selection.  It's rotated regularly and is always unique.  The bartender is always friendly and quick to suggest a good beer if the taps have changed since my last visit.\n\nReally a good place to go have happy hour or dinner.  We actually started going there when we lived down the street.  We've since moved, but we still drive out of our way to go there.\n\nZen 32 it is not (but I think that's a good thing).	positive
This is a great place to unwind before or after going out on the strip. Great place to meet up with friends, cus it is not too loud. It is located parallel to the strip so none of that chaos. The food is delicious, but the portions are tight. I enjoyed the tierra y mar skewers, empanadas,   stuffed dates, fire fries with aoli and their complimentary starter sweet butter and croquetas. I recomment a pitcher of ANY flavor mojitos (more bang for your buck), I prefer mango.	positive
