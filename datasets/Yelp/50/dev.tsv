it says 'dive bar' on the sign, but plays deafening techno music to an empty room on a Saturday night. no tables where you can sit with friends. we wanted a dive bar and it's not, it's just a shitty small club. But even if I forgave it for not being what's on the sign, there's nowhere to dance if someone wanted to. So, not sure what it's trying to be, but it's not working. I felt so bad for the bartender, she was really nice. She turned the music down slightly and the guy working on the computer kept cranking it back up. So loud it was difficult to order a drink without hand signals from someone 1 ft away. Really strange.	negative
This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say \""I'm an undercover Mexican!\"" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try.	positive
WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for $200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.	negative
Being delayed is never pleasant but a well appointed airport could help.  Things like dining options, free wifi, charging outlets and seating areas.  All things that this airport lacks.\n\nThe boarding areas are small and run into each other.  If everything is running smoothly, it's a tight fit but one small hiccup and BAAMM!  It's survival of the fittest.  Try balancing on your \""22 inch suitcase while hovering over a prized outlet while you feel the heat of staring eyes who want your tiny spot.  Geesh.  \n\nMust pack spare battery.	negative
Unfortunately just not very good. Not a terrible experience as the service was ok and busy place but food is marginal and price is on upper end for mex food. $11.95 for chips and guacamole... $8 for the house marg. $30 for fajitas for 2. That's all fine if it is good but sad to say most could make better mex food at home.	negative
we got this room through priceline's name your price thing, and we did get what we paid for. \n\nthe bath towels were shedding, room smelled old.\n\ni give it 1 star for the nice receptionist that gave us non-smoking room at the 63rd floor, and the pillows were comfortable.	negative
We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day.	negative
The yogurt takes just like ice cream.  The toppings are of good quality and include fresh fruit, snicker pieces, brownie chunks, nuts, etc.  A hefty filled cup runs us about $4.50 and is worth it.  You can get a card each time your yogurt weighs more than 8 oz and you get the 10th one free.	positive
Excellent extended stay hotel room with everything you need. Right off the strip so its nice and quiet but super easy to get to the strip. Complimentary breakfast was excellent with so much to choose from. The room was pretty spacious and every room has a balcony. We were lucky enough to get one overlooking the vegas skyline.	positive
I dont like to give bad ratings to businesses but this place is deserves a terrible rating! I have been here a 3 times, and everytime they have messed up on my order. Just Recently I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and I was throughly dissapointed in the service I recieved. The lady I dealt with was extremely rude. I would not recommend this place to anyone. This place delivers terrible customer service and below average mexican food. Don't waste your money on this place.	negative
I had lunch here earlier today and while the food is decent, something really turned me off.  I usually order water to go with my food and when I did, the server brought back 2 water bottles (for me & my wife).  I asked for just regular water but the server replied that his manager can only provide water bottle unless we also order drinks.   This nickel & dime-ing by the restaurant manager really put us in a bad mood.  The service was good (not the server fault) and the food came out fast enough.   \n\nWe order the Chips & Guac, Chicken Salad & Enfrijoladas (I think).  The food was decent. The total bill for 2 lunch with tips came out to about $31 and that includes the $2 charges for 2 bottle water.\n\nCongrats to the manager for forced selling bottle waters to the customers.\nWe won't be back to this place in the future.  I should've drove a bit further to Barrio Cafe.	negative
While the product was good, and very close to the real deal, the owner of this place, Jeff, allows his employees to hand out \""sno\"" balls to customers and other employees to literally throw them at anyone they want. I went here with my wife and 2 year old daughter, and had to stand outside waiting for my order, for fear of my child getting slammed in the face with a ball of ice. Absolutely horrible and unprofessional way to operate such a business.	negative
I like this place.\n\nI found out about Ryan's a couple of years ago and this is my go-to place for when I need certain pet products and want to save some money.  My girlfriend and I have great danes so when we were able to get a massive crate here for way less than other retailers wanted, we jumped on it.  If you have never been here it can be a little weird the first time.  Nothing is really labeled, though they finally put up category signs on the aisles so you at least know roughly where to go.  They have catalogs there that you can look at to find the prices of the products (nothing is labeled on the shelves) and you literally pull things out of bins.  \n\nThat being said, this is a great place to come for dog toys.  You can get a ton of toys on the cheap that are the same quality as other major retailers.  They do not sell food here but you can pick up treats if needed.  They also have a better selection of muzzles than Petsmart and Petco do.  If you haven't been here before, check out their website to get an idea of what they have before you come down.  It is a warehouse so be prepared that it is not air conditioned and can be a little muggy when you go in there.\n\nThe staff is typically friendly whenever I have been here.  I have not utilized the website as far as ordering but I do use it to compare products to other online stores.  If you have pets, I definitely recommend checking this place out.	positive
What a wonderful surprise! It has been a very long time since I had an auto place where the service was friendly, respectful and really beyond what I was used to or expecting. I had my alternator and breaks fixed, prices seemed reasonable and when I stopped in the next day to have them adjusted, they did so immediately and with a smile. I've been won over.	positive
Ordered the #1 right before close: mustard, chili, cheese, and onions.\nDog was out quick, service was friendly, but product was sub-par: small dog looked boiled and old, not at all visually appealing. \nTaste did not seem to include any mustard per the order board, but the chili was actually really good. Onions were weird, almost shredded to death instead of chopped. Bun fell apart halfway through eating.\nThis isn't the best food court I've come across, but there are better options here instead of this joint.	negative
Can't really say anything bad about this place, but it did not knock me off my feet. I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door, but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in. \nPros: Pizza was really good, not great, but really good. Salads was good as well, the food was not bad at all. They had a mac and chees for my son which I caught my wife enjoying as well.\nAll in all, we are going to help promote this business, because of friendly mgr and staff. They will keep seeing us there over and over.\n\nThis place is Good.	positive
Art is not trustworthy.  His mechanic broke something on my car (Not Tom, Tom is a very good guy and excellent mechanic.) and then got very angry with me when I actually (gasp) expected him to repair it!  The next time I came in he treated my wife and I very poorly. We started going through all our bills and realized he'd been overpricing us for years. After finding a better mechanic we were told we'd paid for things, fixed and replaced things we never should have.  We expected better after taking our cars there for eight years.  Art is a scheister taking advantage of poor older folks and families who don't know any better.  Do NOT trust him!	negative
Went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners. NEW NAME IS HAPPY WOK. Ordered Won Ton Soup and all it was was broth, house fried rice and the house chow fun and NO flavor.  The new people were not as friendly and the son (?) acts like he isn't allowed out in public very often. Pretty awkward ordering experince. Off to find a new neighborhood Chinese spot	negative
4.5 stars?  Every person I know that has seen this show concurs that it works better than prescription sleeping pills.  I no longer have faith in Yelp as statements like \""Money Well spent\"" is a JOKE.  Caveat emptor with these pricey vegas tickets.  After watching Le Reve then this the first thing that popped in my mind was \""tourist trap\"".  Go to the RedBox, its much more entertaining.	negative
Very expensive and average. Every other restaurant in our casino was jammed so we went here. Food was ok. My shrimp dish was $25+ for only five shrimp! No pasta/rice or anything else with it. Ridiculous. To top it off, warm beer. Only upside was good service.	negative
I have never been let down by Back East Bagels. I feel completely comfortable just sitting and enjoying my food without being bustled out. Food is perfection and decently priced compared to other bagel/breakfast joints. \n\nI've heard some people complain that they do not offer wifi. I enjoy this but I know others want to be plugged in. \n\nAlso, coffee options are amazing. 6 different roasts and flavors and a variety of creamers. You know..if you're into that.	positive
Order the BBQ Pork, and as soon as I checked in at the location I got a free glass of champagne....allready off to good start	positive
Found this place on groupon. 25$ for 50$ worth of drinks, I mean who would say no to that! Plus I have this thing for tapas style foods so I was very excited to try this place out.\n\nCame here on a Friday night with my friend, it was extremely dead. First thing I smelt was smoke but hey, it's a bar what did I expect? Immediately greeted by Eric, our bartender for the night. He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!\n\nFor the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..\nMango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. \nStuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.\nCrab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. \nBuffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol \nCeviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.\nMeatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.\n\nCocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible. \n\nOverall, I probably will not be returning. Me and friend did have fun there but we have fun anywhere really. Lol	negative
I have been to Peffermill a good few times to play football for the football supporters club. Although never really joining the team properly, I came along whenever they were a player short or needed some depth in the squad. I normally played in a five a side team that was not actually part of the uni and played at the Corn Exchange. \n\nI normally played on the astroturf pitches here and this means that you can never get a game to be abandoned throughout the year. The pitches were good quality and the changing room facilities were good too.\n\nThe worst thing about Peffermill is that it is a bit of a mission to get to, but this can't really be helped as there really isn't many other sports facilities more central than this.	positive
Outside of the fancy salons inside resort casinos in Las Vegas, this was the first and now the only nail salon I feel confident in going to.  I went to them based on other Yelp reviews.   I have basic mani/pedi needs and this salon is clean, well decorated and welcoming. I have gone multiple times now and continue to be very satisfied with my service.  Bruce in particular has always given me great service,  but all technicians and staff seem friendly, competent, qualified and grateful for my business.  I continue to simply Walk In versus making an appointment, but know the salon is busy and clearly popular....a good sign of happy customers showing patronage to a good business.	positive
The previous review is no longer the case as I just came here this weekend and ordered a cold cut combo with chips and drink combo and it was $8.00 and change. There was definitely no $14 sub. This place was full of Wendy's, Weinershnitzel, Noble Roman's pizza, Del Taco, DQ/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Panda Express, etc. This was the best bargain place to eat on the strip for both calorie and $ watching. Im so glad this place had subway..:)	positive
Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth.	negative
We came here 1/1/09 right after viewing a traditional New Year's Day movie next door @ Rave Movie Theatre.  Since it was 10pm, it wasn't crowded at all.  I picked up a card right at  the entrance to the restaurant for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree (score!).  We ordered the fabulous mussels (usu $11.50) that came in a bacon cream sauce.  The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.  Pretty decor, plentiful food, had a lot of leftovers for the next day so all in all would definitely return but I'll also ask my Italian colleague what she thinks	positive
$29.99/pp for an awesome 3-course meal? I'm all for it.\n\nMy sister and I got an e-mail from the Mirage advertising their prix fixe menus, so we made a reservation.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but I think they could use more light.  \n\nThe service was great.  We had about three servers tending to us.  \n\nDrinks were awesome.\n\nFood was delish.  To start, I had the mushroom pot pie (SO GOOD), and Jenn had the crab cake, which she really enjoyed.\n\nFor the entree, I had the surf and turf.  They gave an ample portion of steak, but only one (yummy) jumbo garlic shrimp.  Jenn had the salmon, which she thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the 12 layer chocolate cake, and Jenn had the butterscotch custard. Both were AMAZING (and I don't even like butterscotch).\n\nI'd recommend it, especially for the great price!	positive
I've always found large portions to be unappealing as my taste buds  hit the plateau of diminishing returns usually after 3 bites.  Stax solves that problem by offering 3oz sliders around $4-$5 and tons of choices for customizing them.  \n\nThe Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol' beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries at $3.75 was not only delicious but a great deal given the generous serving.  The garlic aioli goes great with it.  \n\nI appreciated the no pressure service.  Even though between the two of us we only ordered a slider each and shared one order of fries, the server was cool with it.	positive
Perfect place for small children!!! Your leather lunged kid could scream and scream and scream, and would simply blend in with non-stop din of the other small kids and blaring televisions. Just like the  departure lounge going to Orlando at an airport!! The food is made for children, frozen boneless chicken fingers and fries, just like at home. Kids can and do wipe their hands on all surfaces available, so you don't even have to think about cleaning up after them. Everything is really, really sticky! Many families have found this place to be excellent, they fill the place. Bon Appetit!!	positive
Very nice facility that is well kept.  Can't wait to see a game with the roof open.  My only complaint would be that I wish they had more vegan friendly options. For instance, I attempted to get Subway but found the subs to be pre-made, which wouldn't work for me.	positive
