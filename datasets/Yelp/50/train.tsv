Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay!  Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with.  Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.	negative
Food is wonderful but staff was very rude!\nI got pastrami it was made perfect!  Tried the original also great! And so was tomato soup	positive
Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.	negative
Lol I am doing a M****F*****G review on Denny's seriously! Well my EX has ties to this location so he feeds me on his dime. This is the spot when I want breakfast for dinner. I always order the same, an Ultimate omelet no mushrooms, hashed browns, and a bagel w/cream cheese. Um WTF they do not have a Denver omelet on the menu. Who in the world does not have the capability to make a Denver omelet. We are talking ham, bell pepper and onion.\n\nWhy not you may ask??? Well rumor has it that to cut cost, they did away with fresh vegetables such as bell pepper. They replaced it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which comes in frozen. They use it for everything now, in 5 or 6 of their menu items. So there is no way to make a Denver because it would taste funky with that crappy seasoned pepper and onion mix (frozen). \n\n\n\nAnyhow, I like the free entertainment this location provides! The more low end clientele, homeless, prostitutes, and idiot and ungrateful demanding hotel staff management whom holds their weekly pow wow here. This Denny's is located inside of a motel and casino for the record.\n\nJust getting from your car to the building is an erotica of funk. Always some prostitute yelling at another, and the \""women of the night\"" switching shifts on the corner!\n\nI really feel good about myself as I am walking into the casino to the inside Denny's.\nI said Denny's is horrible, but not as bad as those call girls just on the other side of the door.\n\nThe one redeeming quality in this location is that they do have Awesome music bumping every time. I am always doing the booty mix a lot sway in the booth! Lol I do I really do. Then I get hit on by a pimp in which I told to take his baby nuts a walkin before they get let a stompin!	negative
I was introduced to Fat Daddys Ice Cream at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest, and in the blazing heat of a mid-afternoon sun it was a welcome introduction.  Here is served old fashioned scooped ice cream, and the scoops are quite generous, and prices reasonable.  In fact, a dollar can be saved by combining two scoops in one cup instead of ordering two single scoops separately.  Right on the food truck window where one orders, the scoops are described as \""Big\"" and \""Fat\"", as in \""2 Big Fat Scoops,\"" and the company stands behind its words.  The scoops were both massive--all the better to beat the heat!  \n\nAnd the ice cream was delicious.  The Rocky Road Ice Cream was smooth and creamy, and just chockfull of nuts and large marshmallow pieces as one would expect to be authentic Rocky Road.  Although the accompanying large scoop of Butter Pecan Ice Cream was not notably creamy, its flavor was true Butter Pecan, and the pecans were numerous and really tasty.\n\nAnother unusual touch for a food truck that I appreciated was that ice cream orders were prepared right after ordering and paying.  So that I observed a Fat Daddys employee scoop out my desired ice cream by hand and sequentially place both scoops into a Styrofoam cup before handing the completed order to me within a minute as I stood at the window.  Great, quick service!  \n\nKudos for Fat Daddys coming to the rescue on a blistering hot Sunday afternoon!	positive
Very nice place to grab a bit to eat.  Big portions friendly staff.  They should push the bacon more it was amazing.  Yes I know all bacon is amazing.  This was bacon squared.   Get the full body Mary and the biscuits and gravey or chicken fried steak.  They will not disappoint.	positive
Mood lighting. Hookup from the Pit Boss at the Asian High Roller place.... not that we gambled... but just flashed some pretty smiles and got VIP passes. \n\nMusic was good. Drinks were pricey, lounge areas were comfy.... dark enough so I could indulge in my lesbian tendencies and check out all the hot girls without being noticed... oh wait.... I think I was just checking out my best friend. Danced and watched the mood lighting change; yes I'm easily entertained. Had a nice selection of perfumes in the bathroom to freshen up!\n\nNot too many sleazy guys in there; always a plus in my book!! Great place to go with a group of friends; not a great place to go to hook up. =P	positive
Love Krispy Kreme  unfortunately Xavier has to be the worst customer service guy. No smile no customer service and when we asked a question he was impolite. No just fricken RUDE. Come in if Xavier is not here. Or not at. All. !!!!!!!!   \n\n\nXavier get a personality or go work in a mine where you don't have to engage people because you are not good at it at all .	negative
I've not hired Bruce, but have attended a few events which were catered by his company. Each one had a different theme - casual Hawaiian bbq, cocktail hour - and in each case, the food and service were just smashing. \n\nThe professionalism of his staff - at the grill, at carving stations, at the bar, at pretty much any point of contact - was just incredible. The host (various relatives) never had to worry about timing, keeping plates full or guests satisfied. I frequently heard other guests commenting about how wonderful everything was. Not one complaint, at least within my earshot - and I am the pessimistic type to listen for those. =) \n\nWhen it is time to cater our own event, I will be calling Bruce.	positive
God, it really pains me to have to update my review for this place. I go here a lot. I'm starting to think it's my own fault for putting up with crappy service.  I LOVE Dunkin Donuts, but the staff here SUCKS.  They screw up on my order 80% of the time and today was the last straw!!! GRRRR I am stewing as I write this. I was running late but seriously needed some caffeine and breakfast to get through the day. I went in the drive-through and ordered my usual, hot latte lite and plain toasted bagel with cream cheese. When I got up the window, she told me they were out of plain and suggested the everything bagel, which was fine. They finally get me my bagel and I rush off to work, Barely making it on time. I go to open my bag to eat my bagel, and it had no cream cheese on it. Ugh. Stupid idiots.	negative
I have been to PCCHH many times and I highly recommend this business. The owner, Nikki Remic-Bannon, has assembled a lovely team of well-trained and compassionate massage therapists and has created a lovely oasis in the middle of bustling Regent Square for your health, healing, and relaxation. Though this is certainly a business, Nikki and her staff make you feel welcome and cared for. I have been to studios where I felt like I was a dollar sign and could tell that the staff were not well-taken-care-of by the studio. That could not be farther from the truth here. I believe that Nikki is in the business for the right reasons and the people who are working for her seem happy and interested in what they are doing and concerned about the clients' health.\n\nThe two therapists I have seen most frequently are Chris Wright and Rebecca Aqra. Both are lovely people and great massage therapists. Chris can do some really intense deep tissue work (if you want it, of course) and has worked some miracles stretching out my head, neck, and shoulders. I know a lot of women prefer female therapists, but I encourage you to try Chris--he is a consummate professional and I was as comfortable on his table as I have been with any female therapist. Rebecca is a bundle of joyful energy who ferrets out problem spots and comes up with creative approaches to encourage stubborn knots to give in. \n\nTheir prices are not unfair, but unfortunately, it is the only thing that keeps me from coming on a weekly basis. If you have an injury or problem, or just need a hour of pampering, PCCHH can help you destress and get on the road to healing. I leave every time happy -- happy with the service I received and happy to do business with such lovely, caring people.	positive
The concept is good but the finished product is a mess.  \n\nLagasse's Stadium is a cross between Philippe Stark and a dive bar.  Go figure.\n\nSeveral televisions on several different sports stations conflicting with what the next person wants to watch.  Little crazy for those who go specifically to see a certain game at a $25.00 minimum.  Wouldn't be brave enough to order food but the beer is cold.	negative
If you are looking for a great wine shop, that you can also have dinner or share a bottle of wine and feel like you're not in Las Vegas anymore this is the spot.... Hidden in a Strip mall within Desert Shores this place has a deck that sits on the water...cool place for a change of pace...	positive
Yuk I asked for corned beef on toasted rye after a long wait i recieved a tough to chew pastrami on untoasted rye. I agreed to try it rather than wait. It was terrible. The waitress could see I only ate a couple of bites but still charged me full price. So I did what I never do I left not tip and left still hungry. Canters and Langers in Los Angeles still kick as.	negative
I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day.  My car was in desperate need of a bath, and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale.  \n\nBecause I did not want to continue to drive in shame, I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little.  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it.\n\nWhen the soapy cycle of the wash began, I noticed something flying above my car.  To my surprise, I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash \""arm\"".  To their credit, the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth...back and forth.  I think one of them smiled at me. \n\n(A side note...where there are birds ready to poop, they will find me somehow.  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens.)\n\nI am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash.  So I sit and wait.  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car.  Of course, within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes, I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car.  To make things even more enjoyable, the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood.  After all, who wants wet pigeon poop on their car?\n\nMoral of the story peeps...if you want pigeon poop and a car wash, this is THE place to be!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back.  However, I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash.  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.	negative
The Big Burrito is definitely filling and all the ingredients are super fresh. You get a wide variety of salsas to coat your food with, including a jalape\u00f1o and chipotle ranch. The al pastor tacos on Taco Tuesday are something few should ever pass up, especially when they're 2-for-1.\n\nEven at a pretty busy lunchtime the food came out quick and piping hot.  Definitely a place to visit most days, especially every Tuesday.	positive
I hate to be mean but this was the worst food that we have ever had in our entire life. It was so bad it was almost unbelievable. I think they are not busy enough so the food just sits there for hours and hours. I guess if you arrive at the right time when the food is fresh it would be okay but we were not that lucky. The owners seem very nice but the food is just awful, sorry :(	negative
There store employee/manager kristin is not at all friendly. She acts like she's doing a million things instead of providing customer service.	negative
Tonight, June 7th 2013, my family and I had diner at nous Trattoria di Mikes corner Crescent, and Ste-Catherine street, in Montreal, and we got really good service from \u00c9milie.\n\nI wish I could share the same excitement about Mikes restaurant and the two managers tonight, Steve and Charles. I find abusive that Mikes has incresed their beer pricing because of the Grand Prix week-end. There are two prices, the regular one for the beer and the even menu pricing.  When I asked to see the price on the menu, what was my surprise to find out that the Heineken price is not on the menu, an illigal practice in Quebec. \n\nTo insult me enven more, when I asked to talk to the manager he, Steve,  refused to take the time to come to see me, arguing he was too busy.\n\nI hav a bill with a beer at $6.09 for the first beer and $7.79 for the second beer.\n\nThe waitress , \u00c9milie, todl me that normaly both beers should have been charged at $7.79. the price for the week-end of the Grand Prix.\n\nThis practice is illegal.\n\nThank you Charles and Steve for not taking the time to come to see us.\n\nPS: By the way, it is not about the $1.60 extra that I was charged that made me upset, I still left 20% tip to \u00c9milie.	negative
I certainly don't come here for the pizzas - there are about 20 tastier pizzas in town off the top of my head. I come here for the incredible salads! They are a bit pricey, but you can get the full sized (2 meals in one), or knock a few bucks off for half - the perfect lunch.\n\nThey have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one: \n\nMoroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH!\n\nI typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town. The avocado is always fresh and it's always loaded with meat and cheesey goodness. \n\nLook past the mediocre pizzas and try a salad - you won't be disappointed !	positive
I should know better.  I know.\n\nMcDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food.\n\nIt's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger?\n\nMy BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later.\n\nDumb.\n\nThen they had a huge banner that said \""Happy People Day\"" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know.\n\nDuuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?	negative
Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more .. If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order \""Everytime\"" I'm patient I have been in the service industry... Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you... Never again ... I'm finding an Einstein bagel..  This place sucks!	negative
No! The rooms are decent BUT the hallways are disgusting. They need to tear everything out...wallpaper, carpet - they need to start over!  They're current renovating the casino which looks awesome. Be prepared to run into some scethcy ass people in the hallways. Oh yea...one night ALL the elevators stopped operating except for one elevator.  You had to truck up and down the stairs like a hurd of cattle.  Hopefully after they renovate the casino they will then concentrate on updating the room towers. Super old hotel but it actually feels more like a motel.  There was trash, food packages, FOOD, empty bottles, cigarette butts all over the floors in the mornings.  I feel super bad for the cleaning crews. Super Ratchetness!!!  OH how can I forget...one hallway you can actaully see blood splatter on the wall paper.  I about died!  RUN...do not stay here until they clean this ghetto ass place up!	negative
I wish that I had read the other reviews!!! My experience was exactly the same.  I purchased an item that they never delivered - in fact, they never had it in stock and now they have failed to refund me!!! AND THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK OR EMAIL BACK!!! Now I have to work with my credit card company to file a notice of fraud, etc.... PLEASE beware when you shop at this website.  IT IS A SCAM!!!!	negative
great place - David is the man!	positive
I heard so many good things about this place and was very disappointed, first it was VERY expensive to eat for two people, better value and just as good BBQ next door. This was my first time here, and was over whelmed with the experience the workers didn't make it easy I felt rushed ordering and when I would ask questions, they would roll thier eyes....	negative
Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise. Always decent food, and always open! This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning! A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day! In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet! Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.	positive
Huge place to shop for kitchen and restaurant uses...they carry lots cool things...check it out!!!	positive
Visually, the restaurant is pretty unassuming. Inside it has the classic decor of a local Italian dive with checkered tablecloths.\n\nFrom the start the waiter was talkative and friendly, offering us dishes not on the menu. When he mistakenly described the special as also coming with king prawns he promised that he could have it made that way especially for us. The chef also stopped by the table a couple of times to joke with us and ask how the meal was going.\n\nI was tempted by the pasta + wine special for \u00a37.90, but I couldn't resist the Seafood Stew based on Blythe's recommendation. The stew was overflowing with fresh mussels and fish for \u00a315. I'm not a big fan of salmon, so I was pleased that the stew had a rich variety of flavors, including a nicely smoked whitefish. The broth was tasty, but when I went to sop it up with the accompanying bread I was disappointed. The bread fell apart in my hands and had a wholegrain taste that didn't match the rest of the food.\n\nFor dessert I tried the Tiramisu and Banoffee pie. Both were fine, but nothing exciting.	positive
Love this place!  Super cute gem tucked away in a spot you would never guess.  A friend had to tell me about it or I never would have gone. Nice atmosphere with some fun decor.  There are lots of different seating postures so you can find what you like: sofa, lounge chairs, regular dining table, bar seating, and booth seating.  \n\nThe food is good as well. Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.\n\nI will definitely be back!	positive
Love This place.	positive
I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass.	positive
